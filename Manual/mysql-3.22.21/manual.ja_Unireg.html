<H1><A NAME="Unireg" HREF="manual.ja_toc.html#Unireg">I  What is Unireg?</A></H1>

<P>
Unireg is our tty interface builder, but it uses a low level connection
to our ISAM (which is used by <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>) and because of this it is very
quick. It has existed since 1979 (on Unix in C since ~1986).

</P>
<P>
Unireg has the following components:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

One table viewer with updates/browsing.
<LI>

Multi table viewer (with one scrolling region).
<LI>

Table creator. (With lots of column tags you can't create with <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>)
This is WYSIWYG (for a tty). You design a screen and Unireg prompts for
the column specification.
<LI>

Report generator.
<LI>

A lot of utilities (quick export/import of tables to/from text files,
analysis of table contents...).
<LI>

Powerful multi-table updates (which we use a lot) with a BASIC-like
language with LOTS of functions.
<LI>

Dynamic languages (at present in Swedish and Finnish). If somebody wants
an English version there are a few files that would have to be translated.
<LI>

The ability to run updates interactively or in a batch.
<LI>

Emacs-like key definitions with keyboard macros.
<LI>

All this in a binary of 800K.
<LI>

The <CODE>convform</CODE> utility. Converts <TT>`.frm'</TT> and text files between
different character sets.
<LI>

The <CODE>myisampack</CODE> utility. Packs a ISAM table (makes it 50-80%
smaller). The table can be read by <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> like an ordinary
table. Only one record has to be decompressed  per access. Cannot handle
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns or updates (yet).
</UL>

<P>
We update most of our production databases with the Unireg interface and
serve web pages through <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> (and in some extreme cases the Unireg
report generator).

</P>
<P>
Unireg takes about 3M of disk space and works on at least the following
platforms: SunOS 4.x, Solaris, Linux, HP-UX, ICL Unix, DNIX, SCO and
MS-DOS.

</P>
<P>
Unireg is currently only available in Swedish and Finnish.

</P>
<P>
The price tag for Unireg is 10,000 Swedish kr (about $1500 US), but this
includes support. Unireg is distributed as a binary. (But all the ISAM
sources can be found in <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>). Usually we compile the binary for the
customer at their site.

</P>
<P>
All new development is concentrated to <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>.
