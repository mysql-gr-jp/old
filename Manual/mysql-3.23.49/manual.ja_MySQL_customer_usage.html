The section 'Some MySQL Users' contains a lot of different links to
MySQL users but doesn't provide that much information about how
they are using MySQL.   「<A HREF="manual.ja_Users.html#Users">B  Some MySQL Users</A>」節参照. This manual section is to
give you an idea of how other MySQL users are using
MySQL to solve their problems.

</P>
<P>
This manual section is very new and we plan to add more stories here
shortly.  If you are interested in contributing of how you use
MySQL in a unique environment or have success store about how you
use MySQL, you can write to <CODE>docs@mysql.com</CODE> with
subject <CODE>Success:</CODE>.  Note that as we are very busy it may take some
time before you get some feedback for your story.

I think you might be interested in my database size.  The whole database
is currently on 15 servers and I think it's about 60.000 of tables
containing about 5.000.000.000 of rows.  My mostly loaded server
currently holds about 10.000 of tables with 1.000.000.000 of rows in it.
Hugest tables have about 50.000.000 of rows, and this value will raise
as soon as I'll move to 2.4 kernel with large files. Currently I have to
delete much of logs for large sites to hold table sizes in 2Gb.

that contain up to 2,000 million rows in a validation regression database.
