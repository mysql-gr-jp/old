<H1><A NAME="Fulltext_Search" HREF="manual.ja_toc.html#Fulltext_Search">12  MySQL Full-text Search</A></H1>

<P>
Since Version 3.23.23, <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> has support for full-text indexing
and searching.  Full-text indexes in <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> are an index of type 
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>.  <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes can be created from <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> 
and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns at <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> time or added later with 
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>.  For large datasets, adding 
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> (or <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>) would 
be much faster than inserting rows into the empty table with a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> 
index.

</P>
<P>
Full-text search is performed with the <CODE>MATCH</CODE> function.

</P>

</PRE>

<P>
The function <CODE>MATCH</CODE> matches a natural language query <CODE>AGAINST</CODE> 
a text collection (which is simply the columns that are covered by a 
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index).  For every row in a table it returns relevance - 
a similarity measure between the text in that row (in the columns that are 
part of the collection) and the query.  When it is used in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> 
clause (see example above) the rows returned are automatically sorted with 
relevance decreasing.  Relevance is a non-negative floating-point number. 
Zero relevance means no similarity.  Relevance is computed based on the 
number of words in the row, the number of unique words in that row, the 
total number of words in the collection, and the number of documents (rows) 
that contain a particular word.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses a very simple parser to split text into words.  A ``word'' is
any sequence of letters, numbers, <SAMP>`''</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>.  Any ``word''
that is present in the stopword list or just too short (3 characters
or less) is ignored.

</P>
<P>
Every correct word in the collection and in the query is weighted,
according to its significance in the query or collection.  This way, a
word that is present in many documents will have lower weight (and may
even have a zero weight), because it has lower semantic value in this
particular collection.  Otherwise, if the word is rare, it will receive a
higher weight.  The weights of the words are then combined to compute the
relevance of the row.

</P>
<P>
Such a technique works best with large collections (in fact, it was
carefully tuned this way).  For very small tables, word distribution
does not reflect adequately their semantical value, and this model
may sometimes produce bizarre results.

</P>
<P>
For example, search for the word "search" will produce no results in the
above example. Word "search" is present in more than half of rows, and
as such, is effectively treated as a stopword (that is, with semantical value
zero).  It is, really, the desired behavior - a natural language query
should not return every other row in 1GB table.

</P>
<P>
A word that matches half of rows in a table is less likely to locate relevant
documents.  In fact, it will most likely find plenty of irrelevant documents.
We all know this happens far too often when we are trying to find something on
the Internet with a search engine.  It is with this reasoning that such rows 
have been assigned a low semantical value in <STRONG>a particular dataset</STRONG>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="Fulltext_Fine-tuning" HREF="manual.ja_toc.html#Fulltext_Fine-tuning">12.1  Fine-tuning MySQL Full-text Search</A></H2>

<P>
Unfortunately, full-text search has no user-tunable parameters yet,
although adding some is very high on the TODO.  However, if you have a 
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> source distribution ( 「<A HREF="manual.ja_Installing.html#Installing_source">4.7  <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> ソースディストリビューションのインストール</A>」節参照.), you can 
somewhat alter the full-text search behavior.

</P>
<P>
Note that full-text search was carefully tuned for the best searching
effectiveness.  Modifying the default behavior will, in most cases,
only make the search results worse.  Do not alter the <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> sources
unless you know what you are doing!

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Minimal length of word to be indexed is defined in
<CODE>myisam/ftdefs.h</CODE> file by the line

<PRE>
#define MIN_WORD_LEN 4
</PRE>

Change it to the value you prefer, recompile <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>, and rebuild
your <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes.

<LI>

The stopword list is defined in <CODE>myisam/ft_static.c</CODE>
Modify it to your taste, recompile <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> and rebuild
your <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes.

<LI>

The 50% threshold is caused by the particular weighting scheme chosen. To 
disable it, change the following line in <CODE>myisam/ftdefs.h</CODE>:

<PRE>
#define GWS_IN_USE GWS_PROB
</PRE>

to

<PRE>
#define GWS_IN_USE GWS_FREQ
</PRE>

and recompile <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>.
There is no need to rebuild the indexes in this case.

<H2><A NAME="Fulltext_Features_to_Appear_in_MySQL_4.0" HREF="manual.ja_toc.html#Fulltext_Features_to_Appear_in_MySQL_4.0">12.2  New Features of Full-text Search to Appear in MySQL 4.0</A></H2>

<P>
This section includes a list of the fulltext features that are already
implemented in the 4.0 tree. It explains
<STRONG>More functions for full-text search</STRONG> entry of  「<A HREF="manual.ja_TODO.html#TODO_MySQL_4.0">H.1  Things that should be in 4.0</A>」節.

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> with <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes,

<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> with <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes, and
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> with <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes are now
up to 100 times faster.

<LI><CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST</CODE> now supports the following

<STRONG>boolean operators</STRONG>:


<UL>
<LI><CODE>+</CODE>word means the that word <STRONG>must</STRONG> be present in every

row returned.
<LI><CODE>-</CODE>word means the that word <STRONG>must not</STRONG> be present in every

row returned.
<LI><CODE>&#60;</CODE> and <CODE>&#62;</CODE> can be used to decrease and increase word

weight in the query.
<LI><CODE>~</CODE> can be used to assign a <STRONG>negative</STRONG> weight to a noise

word.
<LI><CODE>*</CODE> is a truncation operator.

</UL>

Boolean search utilizes a more simplistic way of calculating the relevance,
that does not have a 50% threshold.

<LI>Searches are now up to 2 times faster due to optimized search algorithm.

<LI>Utility program <CODE>ft_dump</CODE> added for low-level <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>

index operations (querying/dumping/statistics).

</UL>



<H2><A NAME="Fulltext_TODO" HREF="manual.ja_toc.html#Fulltext_TODO">12.3  Full-text Search TODO</A></H2>


<UL>
<LI>Make all operations with <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index <STRONG>faster</STRONG>.

<LI>Support for braces <CODE>()</CODE> in boolean full-text search.

<LI>Phrase search, proximity operators

<LI>Boolean search can work without <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index

(yes, <STRONG>very</STRONG> slow).
<LI>Support for "always-index words". They could be any strings

the user wants to treat as words, examples are "C++", "AS/400", "TCP/IP", etc.
<LI>Support for full-text search in <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables.

<LI>Support for multi-byte charsets.

<LI>Make stopword list to depend of the language of the data.

<LI>Stemming (dependent of the language of the data, of course).

<LI>Generic user-supplyable UDF (?) preparser.

<LI>Make the model more flexible (by adding some adjustable

parameters to <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> in <CODE>CREATE/ALTER TABLE</CODE>).
