<p>
This chapter describes a lot of things that you need to know when
working on the <strong>MySQL</strong> code. If you plan to contribute to MySQL
development, want to have access to the bleeding-edge in-between
versions code, or just want to keep track of development, follow the
instructions in  「<a href="manual.ja_Installing.html#Installing_source_tree">4.8  開発ソースツリーからのインストール</a>」節参照.  If you are interested in MySQL
internals, you should also subscribe to <a href="mailto:internals@lists.mysql.com">internals@lists.mysql.com</a>.
This is a relatively low traffic list, in comparison with 
<a href="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a>.

<h2><a name="MySQL_threads" href="manual.ja_toc.html#MySQL_threads">26.1  MySQL Threads</a></h2>

<p>
<strong>MySQL</strong> サーバーは以下のスレッドを作成します：

</p>

<ul>
<li>

TCP/IP 接続ハンドルは、全ての接続要求を扱い、さらに、
認証を行うためのスレッドSQLクエリを処理するスレッドを生成します

</li><li>

Windows NTでは、名前付きパイプ(named pipe)・ハンドラー・スレッドがあります。
これはネームド・パイプの接続要求に対し、TCP/IP接続スレッドと同様に動きます。

</li><li>

シグナルスレッドは、全てのシグナルを扱います。
This thread also normally handles
alarms and calls <code>process_alarm()</code> to force timeouts on connections
that have been idle too long.

</li><li>

If <code>mysqld</code> is compiled with <code>-DUSE_ALARM_THREAD</code>, a dedicated 
thread that handles alarms is created.  This is only used on some systems where
there are problems with <code>sigwait()</code> or if one wants to use the
<code>thr_alarm()</code> code in ones application without a dedicated signal
handling thread.

</li><li>

もし <code>--flush-time=#</code> オプションを使用したなら、
全てのテーブルを一定期間でフラッシュするためだけのスレッドを作ります。

</li><li>

Every connection has its own thread.

</li><li>

Every different table on which one uses <code>INSERT DELAYED</code> gets its
own thread.

</li><li>

If you use <code>--master-host</code>, a slave replication thread will be
started to read and apply updates from the master.
</li></ul>

<p>
<code>mysqladmin processlist</code> only shows the connection, <code>INSERT DELAYED</code>,
and replication threads.

</p>
<p>
<code>mysqladmin processlist</code> only shows the connection and <code>INSERT
DELAYED</code> threads.

</p><h2><a name="MySQL_test_suite" href="manual.ja_toc.html#MySQL_test_suite">26.2  MySQL Test Suite</a></h2>

<p>
Until recently, our main full-coverage test suite was based on proprietary 
customer data and for that reason has not been publicly available. The only 
publicly available part of our testing process consisted of the <code>crash-me</code>
test, a Perl DBI/DBD benchmark found in the <code>sql-bench</code> directory, and 
miscellaneous tests located in <code>tests</code> directory. The lack of a 
standardized publicly available test suite has made it difficult for our users,
as well developers, to do regression tests on the <strong>MySQL</strong> code. To 
address this problem, we have created a new test system that is included in
the source and binary distributions starting in Version 3.23.29.

</p>
<p>
The test system consist of a test language interpreter (<code>mysqltest</code>),
a shell script to run all tests(<code>mysql-test-run</code>), the actual test cases
written in a special test language, and their expected results.  To run the
test suite on your system after a build, type <code>mysql-test/mysql-test-run</code>
from the source root.  If you have installed a binary distribution, <code>cd</code>
to the install root (eg. <code>/usr/local/mysql</code>), and do
<code>scripts/mysql-test-run</code>.  All tests should succeed.  If they do not,
use <code>mysqlbug</code> to send a bug report to <a href="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a>.
Make sure to include the output of <code>mysql-test-run</code>, as well as
contents of all <code>.reject</code> files in <code>mysql-test/r</code> directory.

</p>
<p>
If you have a copy of <code>mysqld</code> running on the machine where you want to
run the test suite you do not have to stop it, as long as it is not using
ports <code>9306</code> and <code>9307</code>.  If one of those ports is taken, you should
edit <code>mysql-test-run</code> and change the values of the master and/or slave
port to one that is available.

</p>
<p>
The current set of test cases is far from comprehensive, as we have not yet
converted all of our private tests to the new format.  However, it should 
already catch most obvious bugs in the SQL processing code, OS/library issues,
and is quite thorough in testing replication.  Our eventual goal is to have 
the tests cover 100% of the code.  We welcome contributions to our test suite.
You may especially want to contribute tests that examine the functionality 
critical to your system, as this will ensure that all future <strong>MySQL</strong> 
releases will work well with your applications.

</p>
<p>
You can use the <code>mysqltest</code> language to write your own test cases.
Unfortunately, we have not yet written full documentation for it - we plan to
do this shortly.  You can, however, look at our current test cases and use 
them as an example.  The following points should help you get started:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

The tests are located in <code>mysql-test/t/*.test</code>

</li><li>

You can run one individual test case with
<code>mysql-test/mysql-test-run test_name</code>
removing <code>.test</code> extension from the file name

</li><li>

A test case consists of <code>;</code> terminated statements and is similar to the
input of <code>mysql</code> command line client.  A statement by default is a query
to be sent to <strong>MySQL</strong> server, unless it is recognized as internal
command ( eg. <code>sleep</code> ).

</li><li>

All queries that produce results, e.g. <code>SELECT</code>, <code>SHOW</code>,
<code>EXPLAIN</code>, etc., must be preceded with <code>@/path/to/result/file</code>.  The
file must contain the expected results.  An easy way to generate the result 
file is to run <code>mysqltest -r &lt; t/test-case-name.test</code> from 
<code>mysql-test</code> directory, and then edit the generated result files, if 
needed, to adjust them to the expected output.  In that case, be very careful 
about not adding or deleting any invisible characters - make sure to only 
change the text and/or delete lines.  If you have to insert a line, make sure
the fields are separated with a hard tab, and there is a hard tab at the end.  
You may want to use <code>od -c</code> to make sure your text editor has not messed 
anything up during edit.  We, of course, hope that you will never have to edit
the output of <code>mysqltest -r</code> as you only have to do it when you find a 
bug.

</li><li>

To be consistent with our setup, you should put your result files in
<code>mysql-test/r</code> directory and name them <code>test_name.result</code>.  If the
test produces more than one result, you should use <code>test_name.a.result</code>,
<code>test_name.b.result</code>, etc.

</li><li>

Failed test results are put in a file with the same base name as the
result file with the <code>.reject</code> extension.  If your test case is
failing, you should do a diff on the two files.  If you cannot see how
they are different, examine both with <code>od -c</code> and also check their
lengths.

</li><li>

You can prefix a query with <code>!</code> if the test can continue after that query
returns an error.

</li><li>

If you are writing a replication test case, you should on the first line of
the test file, put <code>source include/master-slave.inc;</code>.  To switch between
master and slave, use <code>connection master;</code> and <code>connection slave;</code>. 
If you need to do something on an alternate connection, you can do 
<code>connection master1;</code> for the master, and <code>connection slave1;</code> for
the slave.

</li><li>

If you need to do something in a loop, you can use something like this:

<pre>let $1=1000;
while ($1)
{
 # do your queries here
 dec $1;
}
</pre>

</li><li>

To sleep between queries, use the <code>sleep</code> command. It supports fractions
of a second, so you can do <code>sleep 1.3;</code>, for example, to sleep 1.3 
seconds.

</li><li>

To run the slave with additional options for your test case, put them
in the command-line format in <code>mysql-test/t/test_name-slave.opt</code>. For
the master, put them in <code>mysql-test/t/test_name-master.opt</code>.

</li><li>

If you have a question about the test suite, or have a test case to contribute,
e-mail to <a href="mailto:internals@lists.mysql.com">internals@lists.mysql.com</a>. As the list does not accept 
attachments, you should ftp all the relevant files to:
<a href="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/Incoming">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/Incoming</a>

</li></ul>

<p>
If your <strong>MySQL</strong> version doesn't pass the test suite you should
do the following:

</p>

<ul>
<li>

Don't send a bug report before you have found out as much as possible of
what when wrong!  When you do it, please use the <code>mysqlbug</code> script
so that we can get information about your system and <code>MySQL</code>
version.  「<a href="manual.ja_Questions.html#Bug_reports">2.3  バグや問題を報告する方法</a>」節参照.
</li><li>

If you have compiled <strong>MySQL</strong> yourself, check our manual for how
to compile <strong>MySQL</strong> on your platform or, preferable, use one of
the binaries we have compiled for you at
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</a>.  All our standard binaries should
pass the test suite !

</li><li>

If you get an error, like <code>Result length mismatch</code> or <code>Result
content mismatch</code> it means that the output of the test didn't match
exactly the expected output. This could be a bug in <strong>MySQL</strong> or
that your mysqld version produces slight different results under some
circumstances. In this case you should compare the <code>.test</code>
and <code>.reject</code> file in the <code>mysql-test/r</code> sub directory to
see if this is something to worry about.

</li><li>

If a test fails totally, you should check the logs file in the
<code>mysql-test/var/log</code> directory for hints of what went wrong.

</li><li>

If you have compiled <strong>MySQL</strong> with debugging you can try to debug this
with the <code>--gdb</code> and <code>--debug</code> options to <code>mysql-test-run</code>.
 「<a href="manual.ja_Porting.html#Making_trace_files">I.1.2  Creating trace files and using gdb on mysqld</a>」節参照.

If you have not compiled <strong>MySQL</strong> for debugging you should probably
do that.  Just specify the <code>--with-debug</code> options to <code>configure</code>!
