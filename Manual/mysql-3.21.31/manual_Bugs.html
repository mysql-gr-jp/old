</p><h1><a name="Bugs" href="manual_toc.html#Bugs">Known errors and design deficiencies in <strong>MySQL</strong></a></h1>


<ul>
<li>

You can not build in another directory when using
mit-pthreads. Since this requires changes to mit-pthreads we are not
likely to fix this.
</li><li>

HAVING can only use fields in select expression list. Functions must be
aliased. You must use


<pre>SELECT grp,COUNT(*) as c FROM table GROUP BY grp HAVING c &gt; 1

instead of

SELECT grp FROM table GROUP BY grp HAVING count(*) &gt; 1
</pre>

</li><li>

Blobs can't 'reliably' be used in <code>GROUP BY</code> or <code>ORDER BY</code> or
<code>DISTINCT</code>. Only the first <code>max_sort_length</code> (default 1024)
are used when comparing blobs in these cases.  This can be changed with
the <code>-O max_sort_length</code> parameter to mysql. A workaround for most
cases is to use a substring: <code>SELECT DISTINCT LEFT(blob,2048) FROM
table</code>.
</li><li>

Calculation is done with <code>bigint</code> or <code>double</code> (both are
normally 64 bit long). It depends on the function which precision one
gets. The general rule is that bit functions are done with bigint
precision, IF, and ELT() with bigint or double precision and the rest
with double precision.  One should try to avoid using bigger unsigned long
long values than 63 bits (9223372036854775807) for anything else than bit
fields!
</li><li>

All field types are fixed point fields. That means one must specify how
many decimals a floating point field shall have. All results will be
returned with the correct number of decimals.
</li><li>

All string columns, except BLOBS, have automatically all end spaces
removed when retrieved. For CHAR types this is ok may be regarded as a
feature according to ANSI SQL92. The bug is that VARCHAR columns are
treated the same way. And a compare with a string constat should remove
spaces too. For example the following query never returns anything if
name isn't a BLOB.  <code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE name = 'david '</code>
</li><li>

One can only have up to 255 enum and set columns in one table.
</li><li>

Updates that updates a key with a where on the same key may fail because
the key is used to search records and will be found multiple times:

UPDATE SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY &gt; 100

This will be fixed by not using keys that contains fields that are going
to be updated.
</li><li>

safe_mysqld re-directs all messages from mysqld to the mysqld log.
One problem with this is that if you do 'mysqladmin refresh' to close and
reopen the log stdout and stderr is still redirected to the old log.
If you use --log extensively, you should edit safe_mysqld to log to
'hostname'.err instead of 'hostname'.log so you can easily reclaim
the space for the old log by deleting the old one and doing a 'refresh'.
</li></ul>
