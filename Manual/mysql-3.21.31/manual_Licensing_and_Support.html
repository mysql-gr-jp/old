<LI>

<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> を直接販売するか、または <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> サーバを含む製品
を販売する場合にのみ代価を支払わなければならないことを全ての人に理解して
欲しいです。その一部に料金を課す場合は、配布内に <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> を含めて
はいけません。内部的な使用には、あなたが望まないならば、我々に代価を支払
う必要はありません。
<LI>

我々のクライアントコードは Public Domain または GPL の下にあります 
(readline)。クライアントコードを市販プログラム内に含めるためにライセンス
は必要ありません。
<LI>

我々は市販バージョンにいくつかの追加機能を追加するつもりです。この有望な
候補は、高速に圧縮された読み込み専用データベースです。現在のサーバはこの
ようなデータベースの読み込みのサポートを含んでいますが、パックするツール
は含んでいません。我々が十分な利益をこのサポートから得られれば、これを他

The OEM prices require that you act as a middle-man for eventual
problems/extension requests from users. We also require that the OEM
customer has a support contract.

If you have a low-margin high-volume product, you can always talk to us
about other terms (for example a percent of the sale price). If you do,
please be informative about your product, pricing, market and any other
information that may be relevant.



<H2><A NAME="Support" HREF="manual_toc.html#Support">How do I get commercial support?</A></H2>

<P>
A full-price license includes really basic support. This means that we
are trying to answer any relevant question. If the answer is in the
documentation, we are going to direct you to the relevant
documentation. If you do not have a license/support we will probably not
answer at all.

</P>
<P>
If you discover what we consider a real bug, we are likely to fix it in
any case. But if you pay for support we will notify you about the fix
status instead of just fixing it in a later release.

<P>
There are (at least) four different copyright's on the <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
distribution.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

The <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> specific source needed to make the <CODE>mysqlclient</CODE>
library and programs in the <TT>`client'</TT> directory is in the public
domain. Each file which is in the public domain has a header which clearly
states so. This is everything in the <TT>`client'</TT> directory and some parts of
mysys, mystring and dbug libraries.
<LI>

Some small parts of the source (GNU <CODE>getopt</CODE>) are covered by the
"GNU LIBRARY LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE".
See the <TT>`mysys/COPYING.LIB'</TT> file.
<LI>

Some small parts of the source (GNU <CODE>readline</CODE>) are covered by the
"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE". See the <TT>`readline/COPYING'</TT> file.
<LI>

Some parts of the source (the <CODE>regexp</CODE> library) are covered by a Berkeley
style copyright.
<LI>

The other source needed for the <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> server is AGPL. See the file
PUBLIC for more info.
</OL>

<P>
Our philosophy behind this is:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The SQL client library should be totally free so it can be included in
commercial products without limitations.
<LI>

People who want free access to the software we have put a lot of work into
can have it so long they do not try to make money directly by distributing
it for profit.
<LI>

People who want the right to keep their own software proprietary, but also
want the value from our work, can pay for the privilege.
<LI>

That means that normal in-house use is FREE. But if you use it for something
important to you, you may want to support further development of <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
by purchasing a support license.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="Commercial use" HREF="manual_toc.html#Commercial use">When may I distribute <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> commercially without a fee?</A></H2>

<P>
This is a clarification of the information in the '<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> FREE
PUBLIC LICENSE'.  「<A HREF="manual_Public.html#Public">The <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> server license</A>」節参照 .

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> may be <STRONG>used</STRONG> freely, including by commercial
entities for evaluation or unsupported internal use. However,
<STRONG>distribution</STRONG> for commercial purposes of <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>, or
anything containing or derived from <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> in whole or in part,
requires a written commercial license from TcX AB, the sole entity
authorised to grant such licenses.

</P>
<P>
You may not include <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> "free" in a package containing anything for
which a charge is being made except as noted below.

</P>
<P>
The intent of the exception provided in the second clause is to allow
commercial organisations operating an FTP server or a bulletin board to
distribute <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> freely from it, provided that:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

The organisation complies with the other provisions of the FPL, which
include among other things a requirement to distribute the full source
code of <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> and of any derived work, and to distribute the FPL itself
along with <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>;
<LI>

The only charge for downloading <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> is a charge based on the
distribution service and not one based on the content of the information
being retrieved (i.e., the charge would be the same for retrieving a
random collection of bits of the same size);
<LI>

The server or BBS is accessible to the general public, i.e., the phone
number or IP address is not kept secret, and anyone may obtain access to
the information (possibly by paying a subscription or access fee that is
not dependent on or related to purchasing anything else).
</OL>

<P>
If you want to distribute software in a commercial context that
incorporates <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> and you do <STRONG>not</STRONG> want to meet these
conditions, you should contact TcX AB to find out about commercial
licensing.  Commercial licenses involve a payment, and include support
and other benefits. These are the only ways you legally can distribute
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> or anything containing <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>: either by
distributing <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> under the requirements of the FPL, or by
getting a commercial license from TcX AB.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="User adding MySQL" HREF="manual_toc.html#User adding MySQL">I want to sell a product that can be configured to use <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>.</A></H2>

<P>
I want to sell a product that can be configured to use <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
although my customer is responsible for obtaining/installing
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> (or some other supported alternative). Does one of us owe
you money if my customer chooses to use <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>?

</P>
<P>
If your product REQUIRES <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> to work, you would have to buy a
license. If <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> just added some new features it should fall
inside normal use. For example, if using <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> added logging to
a database instead of a text file it would not require a license.  This
would, of course, mean that the user has to fetch and install
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> by himself.  If the program is (almost) useless without
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> you would have to get a <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> license to sell
your product.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="Web server" HREF="manual_toc.html#Web server">I am running a commercial web server using <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>.</A></H2>

<P>
Do I have to get a license for my copy?

</P>
<P>
No, you are not selling <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> itself. But in this case we would
like you to purchase <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> support. That is either your support
of <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> or our support of you (the later is more expensive
since our time is limited).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="Commercial_scripts" HREF="manual_toc.html#Commercial_scripts">Do I need a license to sell commercial perl/tcl/PHP/Web+ etc applications?</A></H2>

<P>
Is your script designed for <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> alone? Does it require
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> to function at all? Or is it designed for `a database'
and can run under <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>, PostgreSQL, or something else?

</P>
<P>
If you've designed it strictly around <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> then you've really
made a commercial product that requires the engine, so you need to buy
a license.

</P>
<P>
If, however, you can support any database with a base level of
functionality (and you don't rely on anything that only <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
supports) you probably DO NOT have to pay.

</P>
<P>
It also depends on what you're doing for the client. Are you tying into
a database you expect to already exist by the time your software is
purchased?  Then you again probably don't have to pay. Or do you plan to
distribute <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> or give them detailed instructions on
installing it with your software? Then you probably do.

</P>
<P>
One thing I'd like to suggest, folks. Look, development won't last
forever if nobody pays. I agree that buying a copy for every software
user is prohibitive compared to other products available but would it
not be courtesy for commercial developers to register their OWN copy
that they develop with?

</P>


<H2><A NAME="Possible license changes." HREF="manual_toc.html#Possible license changes.">Possible future changes in the licensing.</A></H2>

<P>
We may choose to distribute older versions of <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> with the
GPL in the future. However these versions will be identified as
<STRONG>GNU MySQL</STRONG>. Also all copyright notices in the relevant files
will be changed to the GPL.
