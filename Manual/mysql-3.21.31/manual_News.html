</p><h1><a name="News" href="manual_toc.html#News"><strong>MySQL</strong> change history</a></h1>



<h2><a name="News-3.22.x" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.22.x">Changes in release 3.22.x (Alpha version)</a></h2>

<p>
The 3.22 version has a faster and safer connect code and a lot of new nice
enhancements.  This reason for not including these changes in the 3.21 version
is mainly because we are trying to avoid big changes to 3.21 to keep is as
stable as possible.  As there isn't really any MAJOR changes, upgrading to
3.22 should be very easy and painless.

</p>
<p>
3.22 includes also the new DBD-mysql (1.1830) driver that can use the
new connect protocol!

</p>



<h3><a name="News-3.22.1" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.22.1">Changes in release 3.22.1</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

Added new C-API function: mysql_ping().
</li><li>

Added new API functions: mysql_init() and mysql_options().
One MUST now call mysql_init() before one calls mysql_real_connect().
One doesn't have to call mysql_init() if one only uses mysql_connect().
</li><li>

Added mysql_option(..,MYSQL_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT) so one can set a
timeout for connecting to a server.
</li><li>

Added --timeout argument to mysqladmin (as a test of mysql_options()).
</li><li>

Added options AFTER column and FIRST to ALTER TABLE ... ADD columns.
This makes is possible to add a new column at some specific location
in an old table.
</li><li>

WEEK() now takes an optional argument to allow handling of weeks when
week starts on Monday (Some European countries), or Sunday.
The default WEEK() assumes week start on Sunday().
</li><li>

TIME columns wasn't stored properly (bug in MySQL 3.22.0).
</li><li>

UPDATE now returns a update information about how many rows was
matched, updated and if one got any 'warnings' when doing the update.
</li><li>

Fixed wrong result from 'format(-100,2)'.
</li><li>

enum() and set() columns was compared binary; Changed to be case insensitive.
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.22.0" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.22.0">Changes in release 3.22.0</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

New (backward compatible) connect protocol that allows one to
specify the database to use when connecting to get much faster
onnections to a specific database.


<pre>  mysql_real_connect() call is changed to:

  mysql_real_connect(MYSQL *mysql,const char *host, const char *user,
		     const char *passwd, const char *db,
		     uint port, const char *unix_socket,uint client_flag)
</pre>

</li><li>

Each connection is handled by it's own thread, instead by the
master accept() thread.  This fixes permanently the telnet bug
that was a topic on the mail list some time ago.
</li><li>

All TCP/IP connections are now checked with backward resolving of
the hostname to get better security. mysqld has now a local hostname
resolve cache so connections should actually be faster than before
even with this feature.
</li><li>

A site will automaticly be blocked from future connections if one
repeatedly connects with a 'improper header' (like when one uses telnet)
</li><li>

One can now reference to tables in different databases with:
table@database or database.table.  This makes it possible to give a users
read access to some tables and write access to others by simple keeping
them in different databases!
</li><li>

If mysqld is started as root, it can now change to be run as another user
with the new --user option.
</li><li>

Added cacheing of users &amp; access rights (for faster access rights checking)
</li><li>

Normal users (not anonymous ones) can change ones password with
mysqladmin password 'new_password'.  This uses crypted passwords
that are not logged in the normal mysql log!
</li><li>

All important string functions are now coded in assembler for x86 Linux
machines.  This gives a speedup of 10% in many cases.
</li><li>

For tables that have many columns the column names are now hashed for
much faster column name lookup (this will speed up some benchmark
tests a lot!)
</li><li>

Some benchmarks are changed for get better individual timing.
(Some loops was so short that a specific test took &lt; 2 seconds. The
loops has been changed to take about 20 seconds to make it easier
to compare different databases. 1 &lt;-&gt; 2  before is now 11 &lt;-&gt; 24
which is much better)
</li><li>

Re-arranged select code to handle some very specific queries
involving group functions (like COUNT(*)) without a GROUP BY but
with HAVING. The following now works.

SELECT count(*) as C from TABLE HAVING C &gt; 1
</li><li>

Changed the protocol for field functions to be faster and avoid some
mallocs().
</li><li>

Added flag -T32 to mysqld for running all queries under the main thread.
This makes it possible to debug mysqld under Linux with gdb!
</li><li>

Added optimization of 'not_null_column IS NULL' (needed for some Access
queries)
</li><li>

Allow one to use STRAIGHT_JOIN between two tables to force the optimizer
to join them in a specific order.
</li><li>

String functions now return VARCHAR() instead of CHAR() and 
the column type is now VARCHAR() for fields saved as VARCHAR().
This should make the MyODBC driver better, but may break some old
MySQL clients that doesn't handle FIELD_TYPE_VARCHAR identical as
FIELD_TYPE_CHAR.
</li><li>

CREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX are now implemented trough ALTER TABLE.
CREATE TABLE is still the recommended (fast) way to create indexes.
</li><li>

Added option wait_timeout to mysqld.
</li><li>

Added time column to 'mysqladmin processes' to show how long a query
has taken or how long a thread has sleeped.
</li><li>

Lots of new varibles to 'show variables' and some new to 'show status'
</li><li>

Added new type: YEAR. YEAR is stored on 1 byte with range 0, 1901-2155.
</li><li>

Added new DATE type that is stored on 3 bytes instead of 4. All new
tables will created with the new date type if one doesn't use
--old-protocol.
</li><li>

Fixed bug in record caches;  One could get 'Error from table handler: #'
on some OS from some queries.
</li><li>

New configure option for x86 machines (tested on Linux + gcc):
--enable-assembler.  This will enable assembler functions for the most
important string functions for more speed!
</li></ul>

</li><li>

'mysql' doesn't need a database argument anymore.
</li><li>

Changed the place where HAVING should be. According to ANSI it should be
after GROUP BY but before ORDER BY. <strong>MySQL</strong> 3.20 had it wrongly
last.
</li><li>

Added Sybase command: USE DATABASE to start using another database.
</li><li>

Added automatic adjusting of number of connections and table cache size
if the maximum number of files that can be opened are less than needed.
This should fix that mysqld doesn't crash even if one hasn't done a
ulimit -n 256 before starting mysqld.
</li><li>

Added lots of limit checks to make it safer when running with too little
memory or when doing weird queries.
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.21.13" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.21.13">Changes in release 3.21.13</a></h3>


<ul>

This makes Linux systems much safer!
</li><li>

Fixed locking bug when using many alias on the same table in the same select.
</li><li>

Fixed bug with LIKE on number key.
</li><li>

New error message so one can check if the connection was lost while
the command was running or if the connection was down from the start.
</li><li>

Added --table option to mysql to print in table format.
Moved time and row information after query result.
Added automatic reconnect of lost connections.
</li><li>

Added != as an alias for &lt;&gt;.
</li><li>

Added function VERSION() to make easier logs.
</li><li>

New multi-user test 'tests/fork_test.pl' to put some strain on the
thread library.
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.21.12" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.21.12">Changes in release 3.21.12</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

Fixed ftruncate() call in MIT-threads. This made isamchk() destroy the .ISM
files on (Free)BSD systems 2.#
</li><li>

Fixed broken __P_ patch in MIT-threads
</li><li>

Many memory overrun checks. All string functions now return <code>NULL</code>
if the returned string should be longer than <code>max_allowed_packet</code>.
</li><li>

Changed the name if the <code>INTERVAL</code> type to <code>ENUM</code>, because
<code>INTERVAL</code> is used in ANSI SQL.
</li><li>

In some cases doing a JOIN + GROUP + INTO OUTFILE, the result wasn't
grouped.
</li><li>

LIKE with '_' as last character didn't work. Fixed
</li><li>

Added extended ANSI SQL <code>TRIM()</code> function.
</li><li>

Added <code>CURTIME()</code>.
</li><li>

Added <code>ENCRYPT()</code> function by Zeev Suraski.
</li><li>

Fixed better <code>FOREIGN KEY</code> syntax skipping. New reserved words:
<code>MATCH</code>, <code>FULL</code>, <code>PARTIAL</code>
</li><li>

mysqld now allows ip and hostname to the <code>--bind-address</code> option.
</li><li>

Added "SET OPTION CHARACTER SET cp1251_koi8" to enable conversions off
data to/from cp1251_koi8.
</li><li>

Lots of changes for Win95 port. In theory this version should now be
easily portable to Win95.
</li><li>

Changed the create column syntax off <code>NOT NULL</code> to be after the
<code>DEFAULT</code> value as specified in the ANSI SQL standard. This will
make mysqldump with <code>NOT NULL</code> and default values incompatible with
<strong>MySQL</strong> 3.20.
</li><li>

Added a lot of function name alias so one can use the functions with
ODBC or ANSI SQL92 syntax.
</li><li>

Fixed <code>ALTER TABLE person ALTER COLUMN phone SET DEFAULT NULL</code>
syntax.
</li><li>

Added CHAR and BIT as a synonyms for CHAR(1)
</li><li>

Fixed core dump when updating as user with only select privilege.
</li><li>

INSERT ... SELECT ... GROUP BY didn't work in some cases. On got
'Invalid use of group function'
</li><li>

When using LIMIT, SELECT now always uses keys instead of record scan.
This will give better performance on SELECT and a WHERE that matches many
rows.
</li><li>

Added Russian error messages.
</li><li>

In some cases doing a join + group + INTO OUTFILE, the result wasn't
grouped.
</li></ul>

Added compatibility functions: CHECK, REFERENCES. CHECK is now a
reserved word.
</li><li>

Added BIT as a synonym for CHAR(1) to get better compatibility.
</li><li>

Added option ALL to GRANT for better compatibility. (GRANT is still
a dummy fuction.
</li><li>

Added partly translated dutch messages.
</li><li>

Fixed bug in ORDER BY and GROUP BY with NULL columns
</li><li>

Added function last_insert_id() to retreive last auto_increment value.
This is for clients to ODBC that can't use the mysql_insert_id API function,
but can be used by any client.
</li><li>

Added option '--flush-logs' to mysqladmin.
</li><li>

Added command 'status' to mysql.
</li><li>

<h3><a name="News-3.21.10" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.21.10">Changes in release 3.21.10</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

New mysqlaccess.
</li><li>

CREATE supports now all ODBC types and the mSQL <code>TEXT</code> type. All
ODBC 2.5 functions is also supported (added REPAT). This gives better
portability.
</li><li>

Added text types: <code>TINYTEXT</code>, <code>TEXT</code>, <code>MIDDLETEXT</code> and
<code>LONGTEXT</code>.  These are actually blobs, but all searching is done
case independent.
</li><li>

All old <code>BLOB</code> fields are now <code>TEXT</code> fields.  This only
changes that all searching on strings are case independent. One have to
do a ALTER TABLE and change the field to BLOB if one wants to have tests
done case dependent.
</li><li>

Fixed some configure issues.
</li><li>

Made the locking code a bit safer. Fixed very unlikely
dead lock situation.
</li><li>

Fixed a couple of bugs in the range optimiser. Now the new range benchmark
test-select works.
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>

Added --enable-unix-socket=pathname arg to configure.
</li><li>

Fixed a couple of portable problems with include files.
</li><li>

Fixed bug in range calculation that could return empty
set when searching on multiple key with only one entry (very rare).
</li><li>

Most things ported to FSU threads, which should allow <strong>MySQL</strong> to
run on SCO.  「<a href="manual_Installing.html#SCO">SCO notes.</a>」節参照 .
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.21.8" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.21.8">Changes in release 3.21.8</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

Works now in Solaris 2.6
</li><li>

Added handling of calculation of sum() functions.
One can now use for example: SUM(column)/COUNT(column)

Added handling of trigometric functions: PI(), ACOS(), ASIN(), ATAN(),
COS(), SIN() and TAN().
</li><li>

New languages: norwegian, norwegian-ny and portuguese.
</li><li>

Fixed parameter bug in net_print in procedure.cc.
</li><li>

Fixed a cople of memory leaks.
</li><li>

Now allow also the old SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE syntax.
</li><li>

Fixed bug with group by and select on key with many values.
</li><li>

mysql_fetch_lengths() returned sometimes wrong lengths when one used
mysql_use_result(). This affected at least some cases of mysqldump --quick.
</li><li>

Fixed bug in optimisation of WHERE const op field.
</li><li>

Fixed problem when sorting on NULL fields.
</li><li>

Fixed a couple of 64bit (Alpha) problems

Added option --pid-file=# to mysqld
</li><li>

Added date formating to from_unixtime(), originally by Zeev Suraski.
</li><li>

Fixed bug in BETWEEN in range optimiser (Did only test = of the first
argument).
</li><li>

Added machine dependent files for mit-pthreads i386-SCO. There is probably
more to do to get this to work on SCO 3.5. 
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.21.7" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.21.7">Changes in release 3.21.7</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

Changed to Makefile.am to take advantage of automake 1.2.
</li><li>

Added the beginnings of a benchmark suite.
</li><li>

Added more secure password handling.
</li><li>

Added new client function: mysql_errno() to get the error number of
the error message. This makes error checking in the client much easier.
This makes the new server incompatible with the 3.20.# server when running
without --old-protocol.  The client code is backward compatible.
More information can be found in the README file!
</li><li>

Fixed some problems when using very long, illegal names.
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.21.6" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.21.6">Changes in release 3.21.6</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

Fixed more portability issues (wrong sigwait and sigset define)
</li><li>

configure should now be able to detect the last argument to accept().
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.21.5" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.21.5">Changes in release 3.21.5</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

Should now work at FreeBSD 3.0, if one used the FreeBSD-3.0-libc_r-1.0.diff
which can be found at <a href="http://www.tcx.se/Download/Patches">http://www.tcx.se/Download/Patches</a>
</li><li>

Added new option to mysqld: -O tmp_table_size=#
</li><li>

New function from_unixtime(timestamp) which returns a date string in
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:DD format.
</li><li>

New function sec_to_time(seconds) which returns a string in H:MM:SS format.
</li><li>

new function: substring_index(), originally by Zeev Suraski.
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.21.4" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.21.4">Changes in release 3.21.4</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

Should now configure and compile on OSF1 4.0 with the Dec compiler.
</li><li>

configure and compile on BSD/OS 3.0 works, but due to some bugs in
BSD/OS 3.0, mysqld doesn't work on it yet.
</li><li>

configure and compile on FreeBSD 3.0, but I couldn't get pthread_create to
work.
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.21.3" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.21.3">Changes in release 3.21.3</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

Added reverse check lookup of hostnames to get better security.
</li><li>

Fixed some possible buffer overflows if one uses too long filenames.
</li><li>

mysqld doesn't accept hostnames that starts with digits followed by a '.'
because the hostname may look like a IP.
</li><li>

Added option --skip-networking to only allow socket connections.
(This will not work with MIT threads!)
</li><li>

Added check of too long table names for alias.
</li><li>

Added check if database name is okey.
</li><li>

Addded check if too long table names.
</li><li>

Removed wrong free() that killed the server on 'create/drop database'.
</li><li>

Changed the name of some mysqld -O options to better names.
</li><li>

Added option '-O join_cache_size=#'.
</li><li>

Added option '-O max_join_size=#' to be able to set a limit how big
queries (in this case big = slow) one should be able to handle without
specifying 'SQL_OPTION OPTION_BIG_SELECTS=1'.  A # = is about 10
examined records. The default is 'unlimited'.
</li><li>

When comparing a TIME, DATE, DATETIME or TIMESTAMP column to a 
constant the constant is converted to a time value before comparing.
This will make it easier to get ODBC and particularly Access97 to work with
the above types. It should also make dates easier to use and the compares
should be quicker than before.
</li><li>

Applied patch from Jochen Wiedmann that fixes that query() in mysqlperl
now can take queries with \0 in it.
</li><li>

Store of timestamp with 2 digit year YYMMDD didn't work.
</li><li>

Fix that timestamp isn't automaticly updated if set in a update clause.
</li><li>

Now the automatic timestamp field is the FIRST timestamp field.
</li><li>

SELECT * INTO OUTFILE, which didn't correctly if the outfile already existed.
</li><li>

'mysql' now shows thread id when starting or doing a reconnect.
</li><li>

Changed the default sort buffer size from 2M to 1M.
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.21.2" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.21.2">Changes in release 3.21.2</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

The range optimiser is cooded, but only 85% tested. It can be enabled with
--new, but it crashes core a lot yet...
</li><li>

More portable. Should compile one AIX and alpha-digital.
At least the isam library should be relative 64 bit clean.
</li><li>

New isamchk which can detect and fix more problems.
</li><li>

New options for isamlog.
</li><li>

Using new version of automake
</li><li>

Many small portability changes (from the AIX and alpha-digital port)
Better checking of pthread(s) library.
</li><li>

czech error messages by snajdr@pvt.net
</li><li>

'mysql' now shows thread id when starting or doing a reconnect.
</li><li>

Decresed some buffers to get less problems on system with little memory.
Also added more checks to handle 'out of memory' problems
</li><li>

mysqladmin: One can now do 'mysqladmin kill 5,6,7,8'
</li><li>

When the max connection limit is reached, one extra connection by a user with
the PROCESS_ACL privilege is granted.
</li><li>

Added new mysqld option: -O backlog=#
</li><li>

Increased max packet size from 512K to 1024K for client.
</li><li>

Almost all of the functions code is now tested in the intern test suite.
</li><li>

ALTER TABLE now returns warnings from field conversions.
</li><li>

Port changed to 3306 (got it reserved from ISI).
</li><li>

Added a fix for Visual Fox Base so that any schema name from a table
specification is automaticly removed.
</li><li>

New function ASCII.
</li><li>

Removed the between() function. On should use the 'col BETWEEN a AND b'
syntax instead.
</li><li>

MySQL now doesn't anymore have to use a extra temporary table when sorting
on functions or SUM functions.
</li><li>

Fixed bug that one couldn't use 'table_name.field_name' in UPDATE.
</li><li>

Fixed SELECT DISTINCT when using 'hidden group'. For example:
SELECT DISTINCT MOD(some_field,10) FROM test GROUP BY some_field;
Note: some_field is normally in the select part. ANSI SQL should require
it.
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.21.0" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.21.0">Changes in release 3.21.0</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

New keywords used: INTERVAL, EXPLAIN, READ, WRITE, BINARY
</li><li>

Added ODBC functions CHAR(num,...) and ASCII(string).
</li><li>

Removed function BETWEEN(a,b,c). One should use the standard ANSI SYNTAX:
expr BETWEEN expr AND expr.
</li><li>

New operator IN. This uses a binary search to find a match.
</li><li>

New command <code>LOCK TABLES table_name [AS alias] (READ | WRITE), ...</code>
</li><li>

New server option <code>mysqld --log-update</code> to get a log suitable for
incremental updates
</li><li>

new command: EXPLAIN SELECT ... to get info about how the optimzier
will do the join.
</li><li>

For easier client code, the client shouldn't anymore use
<code>FIELD_TYPE_TINY_BLOB</code>, <code>FIELD_TYPE_MEDIUM_BLOB</code>,
<code>FIELD_TYPE_LONG_BLOB</code> or <code>FIELD_TYPE_VAR_STRING</code> (as
previously returned by mysql_list_fields).  One should instead only use
<code>FIELD_TYPE_BLOB</code> or <code>FIELD_TYPE_STRING</code>.  If one wants exact
types one should use the command <code>SHOW FIELDS</code> .
</li><li>

Added varbinary syntax: <code>0x######</code> which can be used as a string
(default) or a number.
</li><li>

<code>FIELD_TYPE_CHAR</code> is renamed to <code>FIELD_TYPE_TINY</code>.
</li><li>

Changed all fields to C++ classes.
</li><li>

Removed FORM struct.
</li><li>

A field with a <code>DEFAULT</code> doesn't have to be <code>NOT NULL</code>
anymore.
</li><li>

New field types:
<dl compact="">

<dt><code>ENUM</code>
</dt><dd>
A string with only can take a couple of defined values. The value is
stored as a 1-3 byte number that automaticly is mapped to a string.
This is sorted according to string positions!
</dd><dt><code>SET</code>
</dt><dd>
A string with may have one or many string values separated with ','.
The string is stored as a 1,2,3,4 or 8 byte number where each bit stands
for a specific string.  This is sorted according to unsigned value
of the stored packed number.
</dd></dl>
</li><li>

Now all function calculation is done with double or long long.  This
will give one the full 64 bits range with bit functions and fix some
conversions that previously could give precision losses.  One should
avoid using 'unsigned long long' columns with full 64 bits range
(numbers bigger than 9223372036854775807) because calculations is done
with signed long long.
</li><li>

ORDER BY will now put NULL fields first. GROUP BY will also work with NULL.
</li><li>

Full WHERE with expressions.
</li><li>

New range optimiser with can resolve ranges when some prefix keypart is
constant. Example:
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE key_part_1="customer" and key_part_2 &gt;= 10 AND
key_part_2 &lt;= 10)
</li></ul>

BLOBs contained sometimes garbage when used with a SELECT on more than
one table and ORDER BY.
</li><li>

Fixed that calculations that are not in GROUP BY works as expected.

<ul>
<li>

One can now use BLOBs columns and the functions IS NULL and IS NOT NULL
in the WHERE clause.
</li><li>

All communication packages and row buffers are now alloced dynamicly on
demand. The default <code>max_allowed_packet</code> is now 65K for the server

started.
</li><li>

Changed stack usage to use less memory.
</li><li>

Changed safe_mysqld to check for running daemon.
</li><li>

The <code>ELT()</code> function is renamed to <code>FIELD()</code>.  The new

GNU style long options to almost all programs. Test with 'program --help'.
</li><li>

Some shared library support for linux.
</li><li>

The FAQ is now in .texi format and is available in .html, .text, .ps,
</li><li>

Added new sql function RAND([init])

</li><li>

mysqld now uses the N_MAX_KEY_LENGTH from nisam.h as the max allowed key
length.

filter_nr"
Before you got the error: "Column: 'filter_nr' in order clause is ambiguous"
</li><li>

</li><li>

Added support of comment starting with '--' in mysql.cc (Postgres syntax)
</li><li>

You can have select_expressions and table columns in a select which
are not used in the group part. This makes it efficient to implement lookups.
The used column should be a constant for each group because the value is
calculated only calculated once for the first found row in a group.

<pre>SELECT id,lookup.text,sum(*) FROM test,lookup
WHERE test.id=lookup.id group by id;
</pre>

</li><li>

Fixed bug in SUM(function) (Could make core dump)

<h3><a name="News-3.20.3" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.20.3">Changes in release 3.20.3</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

The configure source now compiles a thread free client library
<code>-lmysqlclient</code>. This is the only library that needs to be linked
with client applications.  When using the binary releases one have to
link with <code>-lmysql -lmysys -ldbug -lstrings</code> as before.
</li><li>

New readline from bash-2.0.
</li><li>

LOTS of small changes to configure and makefiles (and related source).
</li><li>

There should now be possible to compile in another directory using
vpath. Tested with GNU Make 3.75.
</li><li>

safe_mysqld and mysql.server changed to be more compatible between
the source and the binary releases.
</li><li>

LIMIT takes now one or two numerical arguments.
If one argument the argument indicates the maximum number of rows in
a result. If two arguments the first arguments says the offset to
the first row to return, the second is the maximum number of rows.
With this it's easy to do a poor mans next page/previous page www
application.
</li><li>

Changed name of SQL function FIELDS to ELT.
Changed sql function INTERVALL() to INTERVAL().
</li><li>

Made SHOW COLUMNS a synonym for SHOW FIELDS.
Added compatibility syntax FRIEND KEY to create table. This creates in mysql
a non unique key on the given columns.
</li><li>

Added CREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX as compatibility functions. In mysql 
CREATE INDEX only checks if the index exists and gives an error if it doesn't
exists. DROP INDEX always succeeds.
</li><li>

mysqladmin.c: Added client version to version info.
</li><li>

Fixed core dump bug in sql_acl (core on new connection).
</li><li>

Removed host,user and db tables from database test in the distribution.
</li><li>

FIELD_TYPE_CHAR can now be signed (-128 - 127) or unsigned (0 - 255)
Before it was always unsigned.
</li><li>

Bug fixes in concat(), weekday()
</li><li>

Changed a lot of source to get mysqld to be compiled with SUNPRO
compiler.
</li><li>

SQL functions must now have a '(' directly after the function name.
user '(' is now regarded as an identifier and a '('
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.20.0" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.20.0">Changes in release 3.20.0</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

The source distribution is done with configure and automake:
It will make porting much easier.  Readline is included in the
distribution.
</li><li>

Separate client compilation:
The client code should be very easy to compile on system which
doesn't have threads.
</li><li>

The old perl interface code is automaticly compiled and installed.
Automatic compiling of DBD will follow when the new DBD code is ported.
</li><li>

Dynamic language support: mysqld can now be started with Swedish
or English (default) error messages.
</li><li>

new functions: INSERT(),RTRIM(),LTRIM() and FORMAT(). 
</li><li>

mysqldump now works correctly for all field types (even
auto_increment). The format for 'show fields from table' is changed
so the 'type' column contains info suitable for 'CREATE TABLE'.
In previous releases some CREATE TABLE info had to be patched to
when recreating tables
</li><li>

Some parser bugs from 3.19.5 (blob and timestamp) are corrected.
Timestamp now returns different date info depending of it's
create length.
</li><li>

Changed parser to allow a database name, table name and field name to
start with a number or '_'.
</li><li>

All old C code from UNIREG changed to c++ and cleaned up. This makes
the daemon a little smaller and easier to understand.
</li><li>

A lot of small bug fixes done.
</li><li>

New INSTALL files (not final version) and some info regarding porting.
</li></ul>



<h2><a name="News-3.19.x" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.19.x">Changes in release 3.19.x</a></h2>



<h3><a name="News-3.19.5" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.19.5">Changes in release 3.19.5</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

Some new functions, some more optimisation on joins.
</li><li>

Should now compile clean on Linux (2.0.x)
</li><li>

Added functions DATABASE(),USER(),POW(),LOG10() (needed for ODBC).
</li><li>

In a WHERE with a ORDER BY on fields from only one table the table is
now preferred as first table in a multi-join.
</li><li>

HAVING and IS NULL or IS NOT NULL now works.
</li><li>

A group on one column and a sort on a group function (SUM,AVG...)
didn't work together. Fixed.
</li><li>

mysqldump: Didn't send password to server.
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.19.4" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.19.4">Changes in release 3.19.4</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

Fixed horrible locking bug when inserting in one thread and reading
on another thread.
</li><li>

Fixed one-off decimal bug.  1.00 was output as 1.0
</li><li>

Added attribute 'Locked' to process list as info if a query is
locked by another query.
</li><li>

Fixed full magic timestamp. Timestamp length may now be 14,12,10,8,6,4 or 2.
</li><li>

sort on some number functions could be sorted wrong on last number.
</li><li>

if(arg,syntax_error,syntax_error) crashed.
</li><li>

added functions ceiling() and round(), exp(), log() and sqrt()
</li><li>

enchanted BETWEEN to handle strings.
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="News-3.19.3" href="manual_toc.html#News-3.19.3">Changes in release 3.19.3</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>

Fixed that select with grouping on blob's doesn't return wrong blob
info. grouping, sorting and distinct on blobs will not yet work as
expected (Probably it will group/sort by the first 7 characters in the
blob). Groping on formulas with a fixed string size (use mid on blob)
should work.
</li><li>

When doing a full join (no direct keys) on multiple tables with blob
fields, the blob was garbage on output.
</li><li>

Fixed distinct with calculated columns.
</li></ul>
