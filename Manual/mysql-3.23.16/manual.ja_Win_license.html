Evaluation and License Registration.

This is an evaluation version of MySQL for Win32. Subject to the terms
below, you are hereby licensed to use MySQL for evaluation purposes
without charge for a period of 30 days. If you use MySQL after the 30
day evaluation period the registration and purchase of a MySQL license
is required.

The price for a MySQL license is currently 200 US dollars and email
support starts from 200 US dollars/year. Quantity discounts are
available. If you pay by credit card, the currency is EURO (The European
Unions common currency) so the prices will differ slightly.

The easiest way to register or find options about how to pay for MySQL
is to use the license form at TcX's secure server at
<a HREF="https://www.mysql.com/license.htmy">https://www.mysql.com/license.htmy</a>. This can be used also when
paying with credit card over the Internet.

Other applicable methods for paying are SWIFT payments, cheques and
credit cards.

Payment should be made to:

The use of MySQL or any work based on MySQL after the 30-day evaluation
period is in violation of international copyright laws.

<LI>

Registered version of MySQL.

After you have purchased a MySQL license we will send you a receipt by
paper mail. You are allowed to use MySQL or any work based on MySQL
after the 30-days evaluation period. The use of MySQL is, however,
restricted to one physical computer, but there are no restrictions on
concurrent uses of MySQL or the number of MySQL servers run on the
computer.

We will also email you an address and password for a password-protected
WWW page that always has the newest MySQL-Win32 version. Our current
policy is that a user with the MySQL license can get free upgrades. The
best way to ensure that you get the best possible support is to purchase
commercial support!

<LI>

Registration for use in education and university or government-sponsored
research.

You may obtain a MySQL license for the use in education and university
or government-sponsored research for free. In that case, send a detailed
application for licensing MySQL for such use to the email address
<a HREF="mailto:mysql-licensing@mysql.com">mysql-licensing@mysql.com</a>.

The following information is required in the application:

<UL>
<LI>

The name of the school or institute.
<LI>

A short description of the school or institute and of the type of
education, resarch or other functions it provides.
<LI>

A detailed report of the use of MySQL in the institution.
</UL>

In this case you will be provided with a license that entitles you to
use MySQL in a specified manner.

<LI>

Distribution.

Provided that you verify that you are distributing an evaluation or
educational/research version of MySQL you are hereby licensed to make as
many literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the evaluation version of MySQL
and documentation as you wish.

<LI>

Restrictions.

The client code of MySQL is in the Public Domain or under the GPL (for
example the code for readline) license.  You are not allowed to modify,
recompile, translate or create derivative works based upon any part of
the server code of MySQL.

<LI>

Reservation of Rights.

No rights are granted to MySQL except as expressly set forth herein.
You may not copy or distribute MySQL except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy or distribute MySQL is void,
and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

Other Restrictions.

If the distribution and/or use of MySQL is restricted in certain
countries for any reason, the Licensor may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution
is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case,
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
this License.

<LI>

Limitations.

MySQL IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR MySQL, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF MySQL IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD MySQL PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL THE LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
MySQL AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE MySQL (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF MySQL TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.
