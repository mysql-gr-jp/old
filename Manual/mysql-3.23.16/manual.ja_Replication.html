<H2><A NAME="Replication_Intro" HREF="manual.ja_toc.html#Replication_Intro">11.1  Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
One way replication can be used both to increase robustness and
speed. For robustness you have two systems and switch to the backup if
you get problems you witch to the backup. The extra speed is achieved by
sending a part of the non updating queries to the replica server. Of
course this only works if non updating queries dominate, but that is the
normal case.

</P>
<P>
Starting in 3.23.15, <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> supports one-way replication
internally. One server acts as the master, while the other acts as the
slave. Note that one server could play the roles of master in one pair
and slave in the other. The master server keeps a binary log of updates
and an index file to binary logs to keep track of log rotation.  The
slave upon connecting informs the master where it left off sinse the
last successfully propogated update, catches up on the updates, and then
blocks and waits for the master to notify it of the new updates.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="Replication_Implementation" HREF="manual.ja_toc.html#Replication_Implementation">11.2  Replication Implementation Overview</A></H2>

<P>
MySQL internal replication uses the master-slave approach. One server is designated as the master,
while the other ( or others) as slave(s). The master keeps a binary log of updates. The slave connects
to the master, catches up on the missed updates, and then starts receiving updates immediately as they
come to the master. If the connection is lost, the slave will reconnect. If the master goes down, the
slave will keep trying to connect every <CODE>master-connect-retry</CODE> seconds until the master comes back
up and the connection can be established. The slave keeps track of where it left off in the replication
process, so it can use the info in the case it goes down and gets restarted later.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="Replication_HOWTO" HREF="manual.ja_toc.html#Replication_HOWTO">11.3  HOWTO</A></H2>
<P>
Below is a quick HOWTO on how to set up replication on your current system:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Upgrade both slave and master to 3.23.15 or higher.  
<LI>

Set up special replication user(s) on the master with the <CODE>FILE</CODE>
privilege and permission to connect from all the slaves
<LI>

Take a snapshot of all the tables/databases on the master that could
possibly be involved in the update queries before taking the next step
<LI>

In <CODE>my.cnf</CODE> on the master add <CODE>log-bin</CODE> and restart it. Make
sure there are no important updates to the master between the time you
have taken the snapshot and the time master is restarted with
<CODE>log-bin</CODE> option
<LI>

Load the snapshot of the master to all the slaves
<LI>

Add the following to <CODE>my.cnf</CODE> on the slave(s):


<PRE>
master-host=&#60;hostname of the master&#62;
master-user=&#60;replication user name&#62;
master-password=&#60;replication user password&#62;
</PRE>

replacting the values in &#60;&#62; with what is relevant to your system.

<LI>Restart the slave(s)

</UL>

<P>
After you have done the above, the master and the slave(s) should be in
sync.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="Replication_Features" HREF="manual.ja_toc.html#Replication_Features">11.4  Replication Features</A></H2>

<P>
Below is an explanation of what is supported and what is not:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Replication will be done correctly with <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>,
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> will be handled properly as long as the file
still resides on the master server at the time of update
propogation. <CODE>LOAD LOCAL DATA INFILE</CODE> will be skipped.
<LI>

Update queries that use user variables are not replication-safe (yet)
<LI>

If the query on the slave gets an error, the slave thread will
terminate, and a message will appear in <CODE>.err</CODE> file. You should
then connect to the slave manually, fix the cause of the error
(eg. non-existent table), and then run <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE> sql command ( available starting in 3.23.16,
in 3.23.15 you will have to restart the server).
<LI>

If connection to the master is lost, the slave will retry immediately,
and then in case of failure every <CODE>master-connect-retry</CODE> (default
60) seconds. Because of this, it is safe to shut down the master, and
then restart it after a while. The slave will also be able to deal with
network connectivity outages.
<LI>

Shutting down the slave (cleanly) is also safe, as it keeps track of
where it left off.  Unclean shutdowns might produce problems, especially
if disk cache was not synced before the system died. Your system fault
tolerance will be greatly increased if you have a good UPS.
<LI>

If the master is listening on a non-standard port, you will also need to
specify this with <CODE>master-port</CODE> parameter in <CODE>my.cnf</CODE> .
<LI>

In 3.23.15,all of the tables and databases will be replicated. Starting in 3.23.16, you
can restrict replication to a set of databases with <CODE>replicate-do-db</CODE> directives in
<CODE>my.cnf</CODE> or just excluse a set of databases with <CODE>replicate-ignore-db</CODE>.
<LI>

Starting in 3.23.16, <CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN = 0</CODE> will turn off replication (binary) logging on the
master, and <CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN = 1</CODE> will turn in back on - you must have the process privilege to do
this.
<LI>The slave thread does not log updates to the binary log of the slave, so it is possible to couple

two servers in a mutual master-slave relationship. You can actually set up a load balancing scheme and
do queries safely on either of the servers. Just do not expect to do LOCK TABLES on one server, then
connect to the other and still have that lock :-) .
