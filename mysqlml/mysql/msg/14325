 Subject: MySQL 5.0.51 has been released
----

Dear MySQL users,

MySQL Community Server 5.0.51, a new version of the popular Open Source
Database Management System, has been released. The release is now
available in source form (only) from our download pages at

          <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/</a>

and mirror sites.

Note that not all mirror sites may be up to date at this point in time,
so if you can't find this version on some mirror, please try again later
or choose another download site.

We welcome and appreciate your feedback, bug reports, bug fixes,
patches etc.:

     <a href="http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Contributing">http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Contributing</a>

The following section lists the changes from version to version in the
MySQL source code as compared to the last released version of MySQL
Community Server, the MySQL Community Server 5.0.45 release.
It can also be viewed online at

     <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/releasenotes-cs-5-0-51.html">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/releasenotes-cs-5-0-51.html</a>

This  is a bugfix release for the current production release
family. It replaces MySQL 5.0.45.


Security fix:
    * Using RENAME TABLE against a table with explicit DATA
      DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options can be used to
      overwrite system table information by replacing the file
      to which the symlink points.
      MySQL will now return an error when the file to which the
      symlink points already exists.
      (Bug#32111: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/32111">http://bugs.mysql.com/32111</a>, CVE-2007-5969
      (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5969">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5969</a>))

Functionality added or changed:
    * MySQL Cluster: Mapping of NDB error codes to MySQL
      storage engine error codes has been improved.
      (Bug#28423: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/28423">http://bugs.mysql.com/28423</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: auto_increment_increment and
      auto_increment_offset are now supported for NDB tables.
      (Bug#26342: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26342">http://bugs.mysql.com/26342</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: The output from the cluster management
      client showing the progress of data node starts has been
      improved. (Bug#23354: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/23354">http://bugs.mysql.com/23354</a>)
    * Server parser performance was improved for expression
      parsing by lowering the number of state transitions and
      reductions needed.
      (Bug#30625: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30625">http://bugs.mysql.com/30625</a>)
    * Server parser performance was improved for boolean
      expressions. (Bug#30237: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30237">http://bugs.mysql.com/30237</a>)
    * If a MyISAM table is created with no DATA DIRECTORY
      option, the .MYD file is created in the database
      directory. By default, if MyISAM finds an existing .MYD
      file in this case, it overwrites it. The same applies to
      .MYI files for tables created with no INDEX DIRECTORY
      option. To suppress this behavior, start the server with
      the new --keep_files_on_create option, in which case
      MyISAM will not overwrite existing files and returns an
      error instead. (Bug#29325: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29325">http://bugs.mysql.com/29325</a>)
    * If a MERGE table cannot be opened or used because of a
      problem with an underlying table, CHECK TABLE now
      displays information about which table caused the
      problem. (Bug#26976: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26976">http://bugs.mysql.com/26976</a>)
    * The SQL_MODE, FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS, UNIQUE_CHECKS,
      character set/collations, and SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL sesstion
      variables are written to the binary log and honoured
      during replication. See Section 5.10.3, &quot;The Binary Log.&quot;
    * The EXAMPLE storage engine is now enabled by default.
    * Incompatible Change: The parser accepted statements that
      contained /* ... */ that were not properly closed with
      */, such as SELECT 1 /* + 2. Statements that contain
      unclosed /*-comments now are rejected with a syntax
      error.
      This fix has the potential to cause incompatibilities.
      Because of Bug#26302: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26302">http://bugs.mysql.com/26302</a>, which
      caused the trailing */ to be truncated from comments in
      views, stored routines, triggers, and events, it is
      possible that objects of those types may have been stored
      with definitions that now will be rejected as
      syntactically invalid. Such objects should be dropped and
      re-created so that their definitions do not contain
      truncated comments. If a stored object definition
      contains only a single statement (does not use a BEGIN
      ... END block) and contains a comment within the
      statement, the comment should be moved to follow the
      statement or the object should be rewritten to use a
      BEGIN ... END block. For example, this statement:
          CREATE PROCEDURE p() SELECT 1 /* my comment */ ;
      can be rewritten in either of these ways:
          CREATE PROCEDURE p() SELECT 1; /* my comment */
          CREATE PROCEDURE p() BEGIN SELECT 1 /* my comment */ ; END;
      (Bug#28779: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/28779">http://bugs.mysql.com/28779</a>)

Bugs fixed:
    * MySQL Cluster: Packaging: Some commercial MySQL Cluster
      RPM packages included support for the InnoDB storage
      engine. (InnoDB is not part of the standard commercial
      MySQL Cluster offering.)
      (Bug#31989: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/31989">http://bugs.mysql.com/31989</a>)
    * Multiple-table DELETE statements could delete rows from
      the wrong table. (Bug#30234: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30234">http://bugs.mysql.com/30234</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: Attempting to restore a backup made on a
      cluster host using one endian to a machine using the
      other endian could cause the cluster to fail.
      (Bug#29674: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29674">http://bugs.mysql.com/29674</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: When restarting a data node, queries could
      hang during that node's start phase 5, and continue only
      after the node had entered phase 6.
      (Bug#29364: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29364">http://bugs.mysql.com/29364</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: Replica redo logs were inconsistently
      handled during a system restart.
      (Bug#29354: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29354">http://bugs.mysql.com/29354</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: Reads on BLOB columns were not locked when
      they needed to be to guarantee consistency.
      (Bug#29102: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29102">http://bugs.mysql.com/29102</a>)
      See also Bug#31482: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/31482">http://bugs.mysql.com/31482</a>
    * MySQL Cluster: A query using joins between several large
      tables and requiring unique index lookups failed to
      complete, eventually returning Uknown Error after a very
      long period of time. This occurred due to inadequate
      handling of instances where the Transaction Coordinator
      ran out of TransactionBufferMemory, when the cluster
      should have returned NDB error code 4012 (Request ndbd
      time-out). (Bug#28804: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/28804">http://bugs.mysql.com/28804</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: The description of the --print option
      provided in the output from ndb_restore --help was
      incorrect. (Bug#27683: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27683">http://bugs.mysql.com/27683</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: The management client's response to START
      BACKUP WAIT COMPLETED did not include the backup ID.
      (Bug#27640: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27640">http://bugs.mysql.com/27640</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: An invalid subselect on an NDB table could
      cause mysqld to crash.
      (Bug#27494: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27494">http://bugs.mysql.com/27494</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: An attempt to perform a SELECT ... FROM
      INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES whose result included
      information about NDB tables for which the user had no
      privileges crashed the MySQL Server on which the query
      was performed. (Bug#26793: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26793">http://bugs.mysql.com/26793</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: Warnings and errors generated by
      ndb_config --config-file=file were sent to stdout, rather
      than to stderr. (Bug#25941: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25941">http://bugs.mysql.com/25941</a>)
    * MySQL Cluster: Large file support did not work in AIX
      server binaries. (Bug#10776: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/10776">http://bugs.mysql.com/10776</a>)
    * When a TIMESTAMP with a non-zero time part was converted
      to a DATE value, no warning was generated. This caused
      index lookups to assume that this is a valid conversion
      and was returning rows that match a comparison between a
      TIMESTAMP value and a DATE keypart. Now a warning is
      generated so that TIMESTAMP with a non-zero time part
      will not match DATE values.
      (Bug#31221: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/31221">http://bugs.mysql.com/31221</a>)
    * A server crash could occur when a non-DETERMINISTIC
      stored function was used in a GROUP BY clause.
      (Bug#31035: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/31035">http://bugs.mysql.com/31035</a>)
    * For an InnoDB table if a SELECT was ordered by the
      primary key and also had a WHERE field = value clause on
      a different field that was indexed, a DESC order
      instruction would be ignored.
      (Bug#31001: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/31001">http://bugs.mysql.com/31001</a>)
    * A failed HANDLER ... READ operation could leave the table
      in a locked state.
      (Bug#30632: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30632">http://bugs.mysql.com/30632</a>)
    * The optimization that uses a unique index to remove GROUP
      BY did not ensure that the index was actually used, thus
      violating the ORDER BY that is implied by GROUP BY.
      (Bug#30596: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30596">http://bugs.mysql.com/30596</a>)
    * SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Ssl_cipher_list' from a MySQL client
      connected via SSL returned an empty string rather than a
      list of available ciphers.
      (Bug#30593: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30593">http://bugs.mysql.com/30593</a>)
    * Memory corruption occurred for some queries with a
      top-level OR operation in the WHERE condition if they
      contained equality predicates and other sargable
      predicates in disjunctive parts of the condition.
      (Bug#30396: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30396">http://bugs.mysql.com/30396</a>)
    * Issuing a DELETE statement having both an ORDER BY clause
      and a LIMIT clause could cause mysqld to crash.
      (Bug#30385: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30385">http://bugs.mysql.com/30385</a>)
    * The Last_query_cost status variable value can be computed
      accurately only for simple &quot;flat&quot; queries, not complex
      queries such as those with subqueries or UNION. However,
      the value was not consistently being set to 0 for complex
      queries. (Bug#30377: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30377">http://bugs.mysql.com/30377</a>)
    * Queries that had a GROUP BY clause and selected
      [1]COUNT(DISTINCT bit_column) returned incorrect results.
      (Bug#30324: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30324">http://bugs.mysql.com/30324</a>)
    * The server created temporary tables for filesort
      operations in the working directory, not in the directory
      specified by the tmpdir system variable.
      (Bug#30287: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30287">http://bugs.mysql.com/30287</a>)
    * The query cache does not support retrieval of statements
      for which column level access control applies, but the
      server was still caching such statements, thus wasting
      memory. (Bug#30269: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30269">http://bugs.mysql.com/30269</a>)
    * Using DISTINCT or GROUP BY on a BIT column in a SELECT
      statement caused the column to be cast internally as an
      integer, with incorrect results being returned from the
      query. (Bug#30245: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30245">http://bugs.mysql.com/30245</a>)
    * GROUP BY on BIT columns produced incorrect results.
      (Bug#30219: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30219">http://bugs.mysql.com/30219</a>)
    * Using KILL QUERY or KILL CONNECTION to kill a SELECT
      statement caused a server crash if the query cache was
      enabled. (Bug#30201: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30201">http://bugs.mysql.com/30201</a>)
    * Prepared statements containing [2]CONNECTION_ID() could
      be written improperly to the binary log.
      (Bug#30200: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30200">http://bugs.mysql.com/30200</a>)
    * When a thread executing a DROP TABLE statement was
      killed, the table name locks that had been acquired were
      not released. (Bug#30193: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30193">http://bugs.mysql.com/30193</a>)
    * Short-format mysql commands embedded within /*! ... */
      comments were parsed incorrectly by mysql, which
      discarded the rest of the comment including the
      terminating */ characters. The result was a malformed
      (unclosed) comment. Now mysql does not discard the */
      characters. (Bug#30164: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30164">http://bugs.mysql.com/30164</a>)
    * When mysqldump wrote DROP DATABASE statements within
      version-specific comments, it included the terminating
      semicolon in the wrong place, causing following
      statements to fail when the dump file was reloaded.
      (Bug#30126: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30126">http://bugs.mysql.com/30126</a>)
    * Use of local variables with non-ASCII names in stored
      procedures crashed the server.
      (Bug#30120: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30120">http://bugs.mysql.com/30120</a>)
    * On Windows, client libraries lacked symbols required for
      linking. (Bug#30118: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30118">http://bugs.mysql.com/30118</a>)
    * --myisam-recover='' (empty option value) did not disable
      MyISAM recovery. (Bug#30088: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30088">http://bugs.mysql.com/30088</a>)
    * Statements within stored procedures ignored the value of
      the low_priority_updates system variable.

      See also Bug#26162: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26162">http://bugs.mysql.com/26162</a>
    * For MyISAM tables on Windows, INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE
      followed by ALTER TABLE within LOCK TABLES could cause
      table corruption.
      (Bug#29957: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29957">http://bugs.mysql.com/29957</a>)
    * With auto-reconnect enabled, row fetching for a prepared
      statement could crash after reconnect occurred because
      loss of the statement handler was not accounted for.
      (Bug#29948: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29948">http://bugs.mysql.com/29948</a>)
    * LOCK TABLES did not pre-lock tables used in triggers of
      the locked tables. Unexpected locking behavior and
      statement failures similar to failed: 1100: Table 'xx'
      was not locked with LOCK TABLES could result.
      (Bug#29929: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29929">http://bugs.mysql.com/29929</a>)
    * INSERT ... VALUES(CONNECTION_ID(), ...) statements were
      written to the binary log in such a way that they could
      not be properly restored.
      (Bug#29928: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29928">http://bugs.mysql.com/29928</a>)

      query result. (Bug#29911: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29911">http://bugs.mysql.com/29911</a>)
    * Using the [3]DATE() function in a WHERE clause did not
      return any records after encountering NULL. However,
      using TRIM or CAST produced the correct results.
      (Bug#29898: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29898">http://bugs.mysql.com/29898</a>)
    * Very long prepared statements in stored procedures could
      cause a server crash.
      (Bug#29856: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29856">http://bugs.mysql.com/29856</a>)
    * If query execution involved a temporary table,
      [4]GROUP_CONCAT() could return a result with an incorrect
      character set. (Bug#29850: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29850">http://bugs.mysql.com/29850</a>)
    * If one thread was performing concurrent inserts, other
      threads reading from the same table using equality key
      searches could see the index values for new rows before
      the data values had been written, leading to reports of
      table corruption.

    * Repeatedly accessing a view in a stored procedure (for
      example, in a loop) caused a small amount of memory to be
      allocated per access. Although this memory is deallocated
      on disconnect, it could be a problem for a long running

    * Index-based range reads could fail for comparisons that
      involved contraction characters (such as ch in Czech or
      ll in Spanish). (Bug#27345: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27345">http://bugs.mysql.com/27345</a>)
    * Aggregations in subqueries that refer to outer query

    * The [16]SUBSTRING() function returned the entire string
      instead of an empty string when it was called from a

      (Bug#27130: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27130">http://bugs.mysql.com/27130</a>)
    * ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE KEYS could cause mysqld to crash
      when executed on a table containing on a MyISAM table

      (Bug#27029: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27029">http://bugs.mysql.com/27029</a>)
    * FEDERATED tables had an artificially low maximum of key
      length. (Bug#26909: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26909">http://bugs.mysql.com/26909</a>)
    * Binary content 0x00 in a BLOB column sometimes became
      0x5C 0x00 following a dump and reload, which could cause
      problems with data using multi-byte character sets such
      as GBK (Chinese). This was due to a problem with SELECT
      INTO OUTFILE whereby LOAD DATA later incorrectly
      interpreted 0x5C as the second byte of a multi-byte
      sequence rather than as the SOLIDUS (&quot;\&quot;) character, used
      by MySQL as the escape character.
      (Bug#26711: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26711">http://bugs.mysql.com/26711</a>)
    * Index creation could corrupt the table definition in the
      .frm file: 1) A table with the maximum number of key
      segments and maximum length key name would have a
      corrupted .frm file, due to incorrect calculation of the
      total key length. 2) MyISAM would reject a table with the
      maximum number of keys and the maximum number of key
      segments in all keys. (It would allow one less than this
      total maximum.) Now MyISAM accepts a table defined with
      the maximum. (Bug#26642: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26642">http://bugs.mysql.com/26642</a>)
    * After the first read of a TEMPORARY table, CHECK TABLE
      could report the table as being corrupt.
      (Bug#26325: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26325">http://bugs.mysql.com/26325</a>)
    * If an operation had an InnoDB table, and two triggers,
      AFTER UPDATE and AFTER INSERT, competing for different
      resources (such as two distinct MyISAM tables), the
      triggers were unable to execute concurrently. In
      addition, INSERT and UPDATE statements for the InnoDB
      table were unable to run concurrently.
      (Bug#26141: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26141">http://bugs.mysql.com/26141</a>)
    * ALTER DATABASE did not require at least one option.
      (Bug#25859: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25859">http://bugs.mysql.com/25859</a>)
    * Using HANDLER to open a table having a storage engine not
      supported by HANDLER properly returned an error, but also
      improperly prevented the table from being dropped by
      other connections.
      (Bug#25856: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25856">http://bugs.mysql.com/25856</a>)
    * The index merge union access algorithm could produce
      incorrect results with InnoDB tables. The problem could
      also occur for queries that used DISTINCT.
      (Bug#25798: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25798">http://bugs.mysql.com/25798</a>)
    * When using a FEDERATED table, the value of
      last_insert_id() would not correctly update the C API
      interface, which would affect the autogenerated ID
      returned both through the C API and the MySQL protocol,
      affecting Connectors that used the protocol and/or C API.
      (Bug#25714: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25714">http://bugs.mysql.com/25714</a>)
    * The server was blocked from opening other tables while
      the FEDERATED engine was attempting to open a remote
      table. Now the server does not check the correctness of a
      FEDERATED table at CREATE TABLE time, but waits until the
      table actually is accessed.
      (Bug#25679: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25679">http://bugs.mysql.com/25679</a>)
    * Under ActiveState Perl, mysql-test-run.pl could kill
      itself when attempting to kill other processes.
      (Bug#25657: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25657">http://bugs.mysql.com/25657</a>)
    * Several InnoDB assertion failures were corrected.
      (Bug#25645: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25645">http://bugs.mysql.com/25645</a>)
    * A query with DISTINCT in the select list to which the
      loose-scan optimization for grouping queries was applied
      returned an incorrect result set when the query was used
      with the SQL_BIG_RESULT option.
      (Bug#25602: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25602">http://bugs.mysql.com/25602</a>)
    * For a multiple-row insert into a FEDERATED table that
      refers to a remote transactional table, if the insert
      failed for a row due to constraint failure, the remote
      table would contain a partial commit (the rows preceding
      the failed one) instead of rolling back the statement
      completely. This occurred because the rows were treated
      as individual inserts.
      Now FEDERATED performs bulk-insert handling such that
      multiple rows are sent to the remote table in a batch.
      This provides a performance improvement and enables the
      remote table to perform statement rollback properly
      should an error occur. This capability has the following
      limitations:
         + The size of the insert cannot exceed the maximum
           packet size between servers. If the insert exceeds
           this size, it is broken into multiple packets and
           the rollback problem can occur.
         + Bulk-insert handling does not occur for INSERT ...
           ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE.
      (Bug#25513: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25513">http://bugs.mysql.com/25513</a>)
    * The FEDERATED storage engine failed silently for INSERT
      ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE if a duplicate key violation
      occurred. FEDERATED does not support ON DUPLICATE KEY
      UPDATE, so now it correctly returns an ER_DUP_KEY error
      if a duplicate key violation occurs.
      (Bug#25511: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25511">http://bugs.mysql.com/25511</a>)
    * For InnoDB tables, CREATE TABLE a AS SELECT * FROM A
      would fail. (Bug#25164: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25164">http://bugs.mysql.com/25164</a>)
    * In a stored function or trigger, when InnoDB detected
      deadlock, it attempted rollback and displayed an
      incorrect error message (Explicit or implicit commit is
      not allowed in stored function or trigger). Now InnoDB
      returns an error under these conditions and does not
      attempt rollback. Rollback is handled outside of InnoDB
      above the function/trigger level.
      (Bug#24989: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/24989">http://bugs.mysql.com/24989</a>)
    * A too-long shared-memory-base-name value could cause a

    * Slave servers could incorrectly interpret an
      out-of-memory error from the master and reconnect using
      the wrong binary log position.
      (Bug#24192: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/24192">http://bugs.mysql.com/24192</a>)
    * If MySQL/InnoDB crashed very quickly after starting up,
      it would not force a checkpoint. In this case, InnoDB
      would skip crash recovery at next startup, and the
      database would become corrupt. Fix: If the redo log scan
      at InnoDB startup goes past the last checkpoint, force
      crash recovery. (Bug#23710: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/23710">http://bugs.mysql.com/23710</a>)
    * The server deducted some bytes from the
      key_cache_block_size option value and reduced it to the
      next lower 512 byte boundary. The resulting block size
      was not a power of two. Setting the key_cache_block_size
      system variable to a value that is not a power of two
      resulted in MyISAM table corruption.

    * SHOW BINLOG EVENTS displayed incorrect values of

    * A statement of the form CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t1
      SELECT f1() AS i failed with a deadlock error if the
      stored function f1() referred to a table with the same
      name as the to-be-created table. Now it correctly
      produces a message that the table already exists.

    * Read lock requests that were blocked by a pending write
      lock request were not allowed to proceed if the statement
