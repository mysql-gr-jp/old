Hi.

Changes in release 3.21.28
--------------------------

   * Fixed socket permission (clients couldn't connect to unix socket
     on Linux).

   * Fixed bug in record caches;  One could get 'Error from table
     handler: #' on some OS from some queries.


Please use a mirror when downloading!

I haven't managed to get a Linux binary version of the above yet.
(there is already an .rpm, but it will take some time until the
mirrors have found it).

The problem is that when I compiled and installed glibc 2.0.7-5 our
Linux machine will not start anymore. :(

I will probably get this fixed next week.

Yours,
Monty
