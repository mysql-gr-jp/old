In why certain Japanese characters are getting displayed as wrong characters?
&quot;eMantra Information&quot; &lt;info@xxxxxxxxxx&gt; Wrote

<span class="quote1">&gt; The data is entered in Japanese (Shift_JIS) in the html form and</span>
<span class="quote1">&gt; JSP stores the data in the MySQL database.</span>

A special character as 2nd byte may come by ShiftJIS encoding.
for example, -- They are ', \ , etc.
Therefore, it will become inaccurate as SQL syntax, or some characters
will be corrupted.

There are two methods of solution.

1:Escape of the special character.
A character with a meaning special as SQL syntax will be escaped.
Which needs escape are '(0x27), &quot;(0x22), \(0x5C) , and maybe %(0x25).

2: Use another encoding.
You may use UTF-8 or EUC-JP encoding instead of Shift_JIS encoding.
Probably this method is more easier.
However, this method may be unable to be taken if already have many data
by Shift_JIS, or have to use JIS X 0201 characters.

Since you are using Tomcat, I will think that JIS X 0201 characters is
throwing away from the beginning :-)

A special character is not used in UTF-8 or EUC-JP. Therefore, a problem
will not happen even if you do not do special processing.

best regards

# &quot;Jap&quot; is not shortening expression of &quot;Japanese&quot; but insult word.
# There may be some offended persons :-&lt;
# Probably, it will be better not to use at a public place, although I
# have not made it mind so much.
