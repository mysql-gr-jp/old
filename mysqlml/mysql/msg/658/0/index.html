Hi!

Apart from the new function INSERT DELAYED, and the problem with LOAD
DATA LOCAL INFILE, this release only fixes some minor bugs.

(INSERT DELAYED will give a big performance boost for sites that uses
MYSQL for logging. This is described quite throughly in the MySQL manual.)

Changes in release 3.22.15
--------------------------

   * `GRANT' used with `IDENTIFIED BY' didn't take effect until one did
     a `FLUSH PRIVILEGES'.

   * Name change of some variables in `SHOW STATUS'.

   * Fixed problem with `ORDER BY' whith 'only index' optimzation when
     there where multiple key definitions for an used column.

   * `DATE' and `DATETIME' columns are now up to 5 times faster than
     before.

   * `INSERT DELAYED' can be used to let the client do other things
     while the server inserts rows into a table.

   * `LEFT JOIN USING (col1,col2)' didn't work if one used it with
     tables from 2 different databases.

   * `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE' didn't work in the Unix version because of
     a missing file.

   * Fixed problems with `VARCHAR'/`BLOB' on very short rows (< 4
     bytes); error 127 could occur when deleting rows.

   * Updating `BLOB/TEXT' through formulas didn't work for short (< 256
     char) strings.

   * When you did a `GRANT' on a new host, `mysqld' could die on the
     first connect from this host.

   * Fixed bug when one used `ORDER BY' on column name that was the same
     name as an alias.

   * Added `BENCHMARK(loop-count,expression)' function to time
     expressions.


As always:

Please use an mirror for downloading.  Note that it may take up
to 24 hours until all our official mirrors are up to date.

The download page at http://www.tcx.se (and http://www.mysql.com)
sends all download requests to the mirror at ftp.sunet.se, so it will
take a while to get the new version even from the above addresses.

You can find a patch file against the previous release at:
http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/unix/databases/relational/mysql/Downloads/Patches/
(after a while)

Regards,
Monty
