Subject: MySQL 3.23.56 has been released

Hi,

MySQL 3.23.56, a new version of the popular Open Source Database, has been
released. It is now available in source and binary form for a number of
platforms from our download pages at <a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</a> and
mirror sites.

Note that not all mirror sites may be up to date at this point of time -
if you can't find this version on some mirror, please try again later or
choose another download site.

This is a bugfix/security enhancement release for the current production
version.

News from the ChangeLog:

 * Fixed `mysqld' crash on extremely small values of `sort_buffer'
   variable.

 * Fixed a bug in privilege system for `GRANT UPDATE' on column level.

 * Fixed a rare bug when using a date in `HAVING' with `GROUP BY'.

 * Fixed checking of random part of `WHERE' clause (Bug #142).

 * Fixed MySQL (and `myisamchk') crash on artificially corrupted
   `.MYI' files.

 * Security enhancement: `mysqld' no longer reads options from
   world-writeable config files.

 * Security enhancement: `mysqld' and `safe_mysqld' now only use the
   first `--user' option specified on the command line. (Normally
   this comes from `/etc/my.cnf')

 * Security enhancement: Don't allow `BACKUP TABLE' to overwrite
   existing files.

 * Fixed unlikely deadlock bug when one thread did a `LOCK TABLE' and
   another thread did a `DROP TABLE'.  In this case one could do a
   `KILL' on one of the threads to resolve the deadlock.

 * `LOAD DATA INFILE' was not replicated by slave if
   `replicate_*_table' was set on the slave.

 * Fixed a bug in handling `CHAR(0)' columns that could cause wrong
   results from the query.

 * Fixed a bug in `SHOW VARIABLES' on 64-bit platforms. The bug was
   caused by wrong declaration of variable `server_id'.

 * The Comment column in `SHOW TABLE STATUS' now reports that it can
   contain `NULL' values (which is the case for a crashed `.frm'
   file).

 * Fixed the `rpl_rotate_logs' test to not fail on certain platforms
   (e.g.  Mac OS X) due to a too long file name (changed
   `slave-master-info.opt' to `.slave-mi').

 * Fixed a problem with `BLOB NOT NULL' columns used with `IS NULL'.

 * Fixed bug in `MAX()' optimization in `MERGE' tables.

 * Better `RAND()' initialization for new connections.

 * Fixed bug with connect timeout. This bug was manifested on OS's
   with `poll()' system call, which resulted in timeout the value
   specified as it was executed in both `select()' and `poll()'.

 * Fixed bug in `SELECT * FROM table WHERE datetime1 IS NULL OR
   datetime2 IS NULL'.

 * Fixed bug in using aggregate functions as argument for `INTERVAL',
   `CASE', `FIELD', `CONCAT_WS', `ELT' and `MAKE_SET' functions.

 * When running with `--lower-case-table-names' (default on windows)
   and you had tables or databases with mixed case on disk, then
   executing `SHOW TABLE STATUS' followed with `DROP DATABASE' or
   `DROP TABLE' could fail with `Errcode 13'.

 * Fixed bug in logging to binary log (which affects replication) a
   query that inserts a `NULL' in an `auto_increment' field and also
   uses `LAST_INSERT_ID()'.

 * Fixed bug in `mysqladmin --relative'.

 * On some 64 bit systems, `show status' reported a strange number for
   `Open_files' and `Open_streams'.


Bye,
