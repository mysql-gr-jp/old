Hi!

First some system information:

This is ona a Suse 6.2 distribution (the bug should however also be in all
older linuxthread/glibc versions)

((/tmp)) uname -a
Linux monty 2.2.13 #3 SMP Fri Nov 19 15:12:50 EET 1999 i686 unknown
((/tmp)) rpm -q libc
libc-2.1.1-15

I have spent the last week trying to find out why MySQL dies when
using DELAYED INSERT on Linux.  After one week (!) of debugging, I found
that the problem was that sometimes __libc_nanosleep() returned too
fast.  This resulted it that a signal could be left pending and
this in turn gave the thread in question direct access to the next
locked mutex.  This resulted in that the mutex lock list got corrupted and
we started to get weird crashes in MySQL :(
(Note that one will get the same problem if a thread sends a wakeup
signal to the sleeping thread just after the timeout expired)

I have in MySQL 3.23.7 made a temporary patch that it will not use
pthread_cond_timedwait() on Linux until this patch (or a similar one)
is incorporated into glibc.  Note that this patch is not perfect, as
it only solves the problem for programs that uses a different
condition variable on all pthread_cond_timedwait() calls (like MySQL),
but at least this is MUCH better than the previous behaveour....
(I have described more about this problem in the patch)

If you need more information about this, just mail me!

Regards,
Monty
