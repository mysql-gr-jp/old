Subject: MySQL 4.0 released



Hi!

MySQL 4.0.0-alpha is now available at:
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html</a>

You can find information about upgrading from MySQL 3.23 to 4.0 at:
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/U/p/Upgrading-from-3.23.html">http://www.mysql.com/doc/U/p/Upgrading-from-3.23.html</a>

The MySQL 4.0 release includes a lot of new exciting features, like
MySQL as an embedded library, InnoDB (transactions) as standard table
type, UNION, multi table delete and much more.

MySQL 4.0 is basically a 'reconstruction release' that will enable us to
easier add new features to MySQL in the future.  The intention is to
quickly add features list at:

<a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/T/O/TODO_MySQL_4.0.html">http://www.mysql.com/doc/T/O/TODO_MySQL_4.0.html</a>

and then start to work on the 4.1 branch while 4.0 stabilizes.

Changes in release 4.0.0
------------------------
 
   * Added documentation for `libmysqld', the embedded MySQL server
     library.  Also added example programs (a `mysql' client and
     `mysqltest' test program) which use `libmysqld'.
 
   * Removed all Gemini hooks from MySQL.
 
   * Removed `my_thread_init()' and `my_thread_end()' from mysql_com.h,
     and added `mysql_thread_init()' and `mysql_thread_end()' to
     mysql.h.
 
   * Secure connections (with SSL).
 
   * Unsigned `BIGINT' constants now work. `MIN()' and `MAX()' now
     handles signed and unsigned `BIGINT' numbers correctly.
 
   * New character set `latin_de' which provides correct German sorting.
 
   * `TRUNCATE TABLE' and `DELETE FROM table_name' are now separate
     functions. One bonus is that `DELETE FROM table_name' now returns
     the number of deleted rows.
 
   * `DROP DATABASE' now executes a `DROP TABLE' on all tables in the
     database, which fixes a problem with InnoDB tables.
 
   * Added support for `UNION'.
 
   * A new `HANDLER' interface to `MyISAM' tables.
 
   * Added support for `INSERT' on `MERGE' tables. Patch from Benjamin
     Pflugmann.
 
   * Changed `WEEK(#,0)' to match the calender in the USA.
 
   * `COUNT(DISTINCT)' is about 30% faster.
 
   * Speed up all internal list handling.
 
   * Speed up `IS NULL()' and some other internal primitives.
 
   * Creating full text indexes are now much faster.
 
   * Tree-like cache to speed up bulk inserts and
     `myisam_bulk_insert_tree_size' variable.
 
   * Searching on packed (`CHAR'/`VARCHAR') keys are now much faster.
 
   * Optimized queries of type: `SELECT DISTINCT * from table_name
     ORDER by key_part1 LIMIT #'

   * `SHOW CREATE TABLE' now shows all table attributes.
 
   * `ORDER BY ... DESC' can now use keys.
 
   * `LOAD DATA FROM MASTER' &quot;auto-magically&quot; sets up a slave.
 
   * Renamed `safe_mysqld' to `mysqld_safe'.
 
   * Added support for symbolic links to `MyISAM' tables. Symlink
     handling is now enabled by default for Windows.
 
   * `LOAD DATA FROM MASTER' &quot;auto-magically&quot; sets up a slave.
 
   * Added `SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS' and `FOUND_ROWS()'. This makes it
     possible to know how many rows a query would have returned without
     a `LIMIT' clause.
 
   * Changed output format of `SHOW OPEN TABLES'.
 
   * Allow `SELECT expression LIMIT ...'.
 
   * Added `IDENTITY' as a synonym for `AUTO_INCREMENT' (like Sybase).
 
   * Added `ORDER BY' syntax to `UPDATE' and `DELETE'.
 
   * `SHOW INDEXES' is now a synonym for `SHOW INDEX'.
 
   * Added `ALTER TABLE table_name DISABLE KEYS' and `ALTER TABLE
     table_name ENABLE KEYS' commands.
 
   * Allow one to use `IN' instead of `FROM' in `SHOW' commands.
 
   * Allow ANSI SQL syntax `X'hexadecimal-number''
 
   * Cleaned up global lock handling for `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK'
 
   * Fixed problem with `DATETIME = constant' in `WHERE' optimization.
 
   * Added options `--master-data' and `--no-autocommit' to `mysqldump'
     (Thanks to Brian Aker for this).
 
   * Added script `mysql_explain_log.sh' to distribution.  (Thanks to
     mobile.de).

Regards,
Monty
