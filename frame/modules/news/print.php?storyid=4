        <h3>MySQL 4.0.14 リリース！</h3>
        <small><b>投稿日時</b>&nbsp;2003-7-22 9:00:00 | <b>トピック：</b>&nbsp;MySQL</small><br /><br /></td></tr><tr valign="top" style="font:12px;"><td>MySQL 4.0.14 がリリースされました。<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com/</a><br /><br />News from the ChangeLog:<br /><br />Functionality added or changed:<br /><br />   * A documentation change: Function `INTERVAL(NULL, ...)' returns<br />     `-1'.<br /><br />   * Enabled `INSERT' from `SELECT' when the table into which the<br />     records are inserted is also a table listed in the `SELECT'.<br /><br />   * Allow `CREATE TABLE' and `INSERT' from any `UNION'.<br /><br />   * The `SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS' option now always returns the total<br />     number of rows for any `UNION'.<br /><br />   * Removed `--table' option from `mysqlbinlog' to avoid repeating<br />     `mysqldump' functionality.<br /><br />   * Changed optimiser slightly to prefer index lookups over full table<br />     scans.<br /><br />   * Added thread-specific `max_seeks_for_key' variable that can be<br />     used to force the optimiser to use keys instead of table scans<br />     even if the cardinality of the index is low.<br /><br />   * Added optimisation that converts `LEFT JOIN' to normal join in<br />     some cases.<br /><br />   * A documentation change: added a paragraph about failover in<br />     replication (how to use a surviving slave as the new master, how to<br />     resume to the original setup). *Note Replication FAQ::.<br /><br />   * A documentation change: added warning notes about safe use of the<br />     `CHANGE MASTER' command. *Note CHANGE MASTER TO::.<br /><br />   * MySQL now issues a warning (not an error, as in 4.0.13) when it<br />     opens a table that was created with MySQL 4.1.<br /><br />   * Added `--nice' option to `mysqld_safe' to allow setting the<br />     niceness of the `mysqld' process. (Thanks to Christian Hammers for<br />     providing the initial patch.) (Bug #627)<br /><br />   * Added `--read-only' option to cause `mysqld' to allow no updates<br />     except from slave threads or from users with the `SUPER' privilege.<br />     (Original patch from Markus Benning).<br /><br />   * `SHOW BINLOG EVENTS FROM x' where `x' is strictly less than 4 now<br />     silently converts `x' to 4 instead of printing an error. The same<br />     change was done for `CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_POS=x' and<br />     `CHANGE MASTER TO RELAY_LOG_POS=x'.<br /><br />   * `mysqld' now only adds an interrupt handler for the `SIGINT' signal<br />     if you start it with the new `--gdb' option.  This is because some<br />     MySQL users encountered strange problems when they accidently sent<br />     `SIGINT' to `mysqld' threads.<br /><br />   * `RESET SLAVE' now clears the `Last_errno' and `Last_error' fields<br />     in the output of `SHOW SLAVE STATUS'.<br /><br />   * Added `max_relay_log_size' variable; the relay log will be rotated<br />     automatically when its size exceeds `max_relay_log_size'. But if<br />     `max_relay_log_size' is 0 (the default), `max_binlog_size' will be<br />     used (as in older versions). `max_binlog_size' still applies to<br />     binary logs in any case.<br /><br />   * `FLUSH LOGS' now rotates relay logs in addition to the other types<br />     of logs it already rotated.<br /><br /><br />Bugs fixed:<br /><br />   * Comparison/sorting for `latin1_de' character set was rewritten. The<br />     old algorithm could not handle cases like `"sa"" > "ssa"'. *Note German<br />     character set::. In rare cases it resulted in table corruption.<br /><br />   * Fixed a problem with the password prompt on Windows (Bug #683)<br /><br />   * `ALTER TABLE ... UNION=(...)' for `MERGE' table is now allowed<br />     even if some underlying `MyISAM' tables are read-only. (Bug #702)<br /><br />   * Fixed a problem with `CREATE TABLE t1 SELECT x'41''. (Bug #801)<br /><br />   * Removed some incorrect lock warnings from the error log.<br /><br />   * Fixed memory overrun when doing `REPAIR' on a table with a multi-part<br />     auto_increment key where one part was a packed `CHAR'.<br /><br />   * Fixed a probable race condition in the replication code that could<br />     potentially lead to `INSERT' statements not being replicated in the<br />     event of a `FLUSH LOGS' command or when the binary log exceeds<br />     `max_binlog_size'. (Bug #791)<br /><br />   * Fixed a crashing bug in `INTERVAL' and `GROUP BY' or `DISTINCT'.<br />     (Bug #807)<br /><br />   * Fixed bug in `mysqlhotcopy' so it actually aborts for unsuccessful<br />     table copying operations.  Fixed another bug so that it succeeds<br />     when there are thousands of tables to copy. (Bug #812)<br /><br />   * Fixed problem with `mysqlhotcopy' failing to read options from<br />     option files. (Bug #808)<br /><br />   * Fixed bugs in optimiser that sometimes prevented MySQL from using<br />     `FULLTEXT' indexes even though it was possible (for example, in<br />     `SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE MATCH a,b AGAINST("index") > 0').<br /><br />   * Fixed a bug with "table is full" in `UNION' operations.<br /><br />   * Fixed a security problem that enabled users with no privileges to<br />     obtain information on the list of existing databases by using<br />     `SHOW TABLES' and similar commands.<br /><br />   * Fixed a stack problem on UnixWare/OpenServer.<br /><br />   * Fixed a configuration problem on UnixWare/OpenUnix and OpenServer.<br /><br />   * Fixed a stack overflow problem in password verification.<br /><br />   * Fixed a problem with `max_user_connections'.<br /><br />   * `HANDLER' without an index now works properly when a table has<br />     deleted rows. (Bug #787)<br /><br />   * Fixed a bug with `LOAD DATA' in `mysqlbinlog'. (Bug #670).<br /><br />   * Fixed that `SET CHARACTER SET DEFAULT' works. (Bug #462)<br /><br />   * Fixed `MERGE' table behaviour in `ORDER BY ... DESC' queries.<br />     (Bug #515)<br /><br />   * Fixed server crash on `PURGE MASTER LOGS' or `SHOW MASTER LOGS'<br />     when the binary log is off. (Bug #733)<br /><br />   * Fixed password-checking problem on Windows. (Bug #464)<br /><br />   * Fixed the bug in comparison of a `DATETIME' column and an integer<br />     constant.  (Bug #504)<br /><br />   * Fixed remote mode of `mysqlbinlog'. (Bug #672)<br /><br />   * Fixed `ERROR 1105: Unknown error' that occurred for some `SELECT'<br />     queries, where a column that was declared as `NOT NULL' was<br />     compared with an expression that took `NULL' value.<br /><br />   * Changed timeout in `mysql_real_connect()' to use `poll()' instead<br />     of `select()' to work around problem with many open files in the<br />     client.<br /><br />   * Fixed incorrect results from `MATCH ... AGAINST' used with a `LEFT<br />     JOIN' query.<br /><br />   * Fixed a bug that limited the maximum value for `mysqld' variables<br />     to 4294967295 when they are specified on the command line.<br /><br />   * Fixed a bug that sometimes caused spurious "Access denied" errors<br />     in `HANDLER ... READ' statements, when a table is referenced via<br />     an alias.<br /><br />   * Fixed portability problem with `safe_malloc', which caused MySQL to<br />     give "Freeing wrong aligned pointer" errors on SCO 3.2.<br /><br />   * `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE/DISABLE KEYS' could cause a core dump when<br />     done after an `INSERT DELAYED' statement on the same table.<br /><br />   * Fixed problem with conversion of localtime to GMT where some times<br />     resulted in different (but correct) timestamps. Now MySQL should<br />     use the smallest possible timestamp value in this case.  (Bug #316)<br /><br />   * Very small query cache sizes could crash `mysqld'. (Bug #549)<br /><br />   * Fixed a bug (accidentally introduced by us but present only in<br />     version 4.0.13) that made `INSERT ... SELECT' into an<br />     `AUTO_INCREMENT' column not replicate well. This bug is in the<br />     master, not in the slave.  (Bug #490)<br /><br />   * Fixed a bug: When an `INSERT ... SELECT' statement inserted rows<br />     into a non-transactional table, but failed at some point (for<br />     example, due to a "Duplicate key" error), the query was not<br />     written to the binlog.  Now it is written to the binlog, with its<br />     error code, as all other queries are. About the<br />     `slave-skip-errors' option for how to handle partially completed<br />     queries in the slave, see *Note Replication Options::. (Bug #491)<br /><br />   * `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0' was not replicated properly.  The fix<br />     probably will not be backported to 3.23.<br /><br />   * On a slave, `LOAD DATA INFILE' which had no `IGNORE' or `REPLACE'<br />     clause on the master, was replicated with `IGNORE'.  While this is<br />     not a problem if the master and slave data are identical (a `LOAD'<br />     that produces no duplicate conflicts on the master will produce<br />     none on the slave anyway), which is true in normal operation, it<br />     is better for debugging not to silently add the `IGNORE'. That way,<br />     you can get an error message on the slave and discover that for<br />     some reason, the data on master and slave are different and<br />     investigate why.  (Bug #571)<br /><br />   * On a slave, `LOAD DATA INFILE' printed an incomplete "Duplicate<br />     entry '%-.64s' for key %d"' message (the key name and value were<br />     not mentioned) in case of duplicate conflict (which does not<br />     happen in normal operation).  (Bug #573)<br /><br />   * When using a slave compiled with `--debug', `CHANGE MASTER TO<br />     RELAY_LOG_POS' could cause a debug assertion failure. (Bug #576)<br /><br />   * When doing a `LOCK TABLES WRITE' on an InnoDB table, commit could<br />     not happen, if the query was not written to the binary log (for<br />     example, if `--log-bin' was not used, or `binlog-ignore-db' was<br />     used). (Bug #578)<br /><br />   * If a 3.23 master had open temporary tables that had been<br />     replicated to a 4.0 slave, and the binlog got rotated, these<br />     temporary tables were immediately dropped by the slave (which<br />     caused problems if the master used them subsequently). This bug<br />     had been fixed in 4.0.13, but in a manner which caused an unlikely<br />     inconvenience: if the 3.23 master died brutally (power failure),<br />     without having enough time to automatically write `DROP TABLE'<br />     statements to its binlog, then the 4.0.13 slave would not notice<br />     the temporary tables have to be dropped, until the slave `mysqld'<br />     server is restarted. This minor inconvenience is fixed in 3.23.57<br />     and 4.0.14 (meaning the master must be upgraded to 3.23.57 and the<br />     slave to 4.0.14 to remove the inconvenience). (Bug #254)<br /><br />   * If `MASTER_POS_WAIT()' was waiting, and the slave was idle, and<br />     the SQL slave thread terminated, `MASTER_POS_WAIT()' would wait<br />     forever. Now when the SQL slave thread terminates,<br />     `MASTER_POS_WAIT()' immediately returns `NULL' ("slave stopped").<br />     (Bug #651)<br /><br />   * After `RESET SLAVE; START SLAVE;', the `Relay_log_space' value<br />     displayed by `SHOW SLAVE STATUS' was too big by four bytes. (Bug<br />     #763)<br /><br />   * If a query was ignored on the slave (because of<br />     `replicate-ignore-table' and other similar rules), the slave still<br />     checked if the query got the same error code (0, no error) as on<br />     the master. So if the master had an error on the query (for<br />     example, "Duplicate entry" in a multiple-row insert), then the<br />     slave stopped and warned that the error codes didn't match. (Bug<br />     #797)<br /><br /><br />Additional notes:<br /><br />   * In addition to Solaris 8/9 for SPARC, we now also offer binaries<br />     for Sun Solaris 8 on the Intel x86 architecture.<br /><br />   * Binaries for FreeBSD 5.0 (sparc64) have been added (thanks to Ken<br />     McKittrick for granting us access to such a system)<br /><br />   * Due to technical problems with the build hosts, we currently can not<br />     offer binaries for Linux/s390 and binaries for AIX 4.3 (compiled with<br />     gcc). These will be added as soon as these problems have been<br />     resolved. We apologize for any inconveniences that may cause you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
