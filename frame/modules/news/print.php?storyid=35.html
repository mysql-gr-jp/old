        <h3>MySQL 4.0.24 リリース！</h3>
        <small><b>投稿日時</b>&nbsp;2005-3-12 10:35:17 | <b>トピック：</b>&nbsp;MySQL</small><br /><br /></td></tr><tr valign="top" style="font:12px;"><td>バージョン 4.1.10a のリリースと同時に、 バージョン 4.0系の最新バージョンである バージョン 4.0.24 も公開されました。<br />4.1.10a と同様に、UDFに関する セキュリティ問題の修正が含まれています。<br />また UDF問題のほかにも、4.0.24 では数多くの修正が加えられています。詳しくはチェンジログを参照ください。<br /><br />　ダウンロードは <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL AB</a> のサイトからどうぞ。<br /><br /><br /><br />以下チェンジログ：<br /><br />■機能の追加と変更：<br />* Security improvement: The server creates `.frm', `.MYD', `.MYI', `.MRG', `.ISD', and `.ISM' table files only if a file with the same name does not already exist.<br /><br />* Security improvement: User-defined functions should have at least one symbol defined in addition to the `xxx' symbol that corresponds to the main `xxx()' function.  These auxiliary symbols correspond to the `xxx_init()', `xxx_deinit()', `xxx_reset()',<br />  `xxx_clear()', and `xxx_add()' functions.  `mysqld' by default no longer loads UDFs unless they have at least one auxiliary symbol defined in addition to the main symbol.<br />  The '--allow-suspicious-udfs' option controls whether UDFs that have only an `xxx' symbol can be loaded. <br />  By default, the option is off.  `mysqld' also checks UDF filenames when it reads them from the `mysql.func' table and rejects those that contain directory pathname separator characters. (It already checked names as given in `CREATE FUNCTION' statements.)<br />  See the section in the manual on writing UDFs.<br /><br />* `InnoDB': Added configuration option and settable global variable `innodb_autoextend_increment' for setting the size in megabytes by which `InnoDB' tablespaces are extended when they become full.  The default value is 8, corresponding to the fixed increment of 8MB in previous versions of MySQL.<br /><br />* InnoDB: Do not acquire an internal `InnoDB' table lock in `LOCK TABLES' if `AUTOCOMMIT=1'. This helps in porting old `MyISAM' applications to `InnoDB'. `InnoDB' table locks in that case caused deadlocks very easily.<br /><br /><br />■バグ修正：<br />* `FOUND_ROWS()' returned an incorrect value after a `SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS DISTINCT' statement that selected constants and included `GROUP BY' and `LIMIT' clauses. (Bug #7945)<br /><br />* Queries of the form `(SELECT ...) ORDER BY ...' were being treated as a `UNION'.  This improperly resulted in only distinct values being returned (because `UNION' by default eliminates.) (Bug #7672)<br /><br />* Index cardinality was not being updated properly for `TEMPOARY' tables under some circumstances, such as `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT' followed by `ANALYZE TABLE'. (Bug #7519)<br /><br />* Fixed a server crash caused by `DELETE FROM TBL_NAME ...  WHERE ... ORDER BY TBL_NAME.COL_NAME' when the `ORDER BY' column was qualified with the table name. (Bug #8392)<br /><br />* Fixed a bug in `MATCH ... AGAINST' in natural language mode that could cause a server crash if the `FULLTEXT' index was not used in a join (`EXPLAIN' did not show `fulltext' join mode) and the search query matched no rows in the table (Bug #8522).<br /><br />* Platform and architecture information in version information produced for `--version' option on Windows was always `Win95/Win98 (i32)'.  More accurately determine platform as `Win32' or `Win64' for 32-bit or 64-bit Windows, and architecture as `ia32' for x86, `ia64' for Itanium, and `axp' for Alpha. (Bug #4445)<br /><br />* `InnoDB': Honor the `--tmpdir' startup option when creating temporary files.  Previously, `InnoDB' temporary files were always created in the temporary directory of the operating system.  On Netware, `InnoDB' will continue to ignore `--tmpdir'.  (Bug #5822)<br /><br />* Fixed an optimization problem that allowed a negative number to be stored in a `DOUBLE UNSIGNED' column when it was assigned a value from a signed `DOUBLE' column. (Bug #7700)<br /><br />* Fixed a failure of multiple-table updates to replicate properly on slave servers when `--replicate-*-table' options had been specified.  (Bug #7011)<br /><br />* Renamed `set_bit()' and `clear_bit()' functions in source code to avoid a conflict with functions of the same names in Linux kernel header files.  (Bug #7971)<br /><br />* Part of the information being used to cache access-permission lookups was not always reinitialized properly, particularly for connections from localhost on Windows. The result was connection failures that appeared to occur randomly.  (Bug #5569)<br /><br />* Corrected a problem with the `QUOTE()' function returning bad results.  (Bug #8248)<br /><br />* Fixed a problem where `INSERT INTO ...SELECT' failed when the source and target table were the same. (Bug #6034)<br /><br />* Fixed a problem where RPM installation on Linux as a non-privileged user would result in incomplete installation. (Bug #7347)<br /><br />* Change thread stack size used for building Linx RPM distributions to avoid warnings about stack size during server startup. (Bug #6226)<br /><br />* InnoDB: Use native `tmpfile()' function on Netware.  All InnoDB temporary files are created under `sys:\tmp'.  Previously, InnoDB temporary files were never deleted on Netware.<br /><br />* Fixed a symlink vulnerability in the `mysqlaccess' script. Reported by Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pena and Debian Security Audit Team (<a href="http://www.debian.org/security/audit" target="_blank">http://www.debian.org/security/audit</a>).  (CAN-2005-0004 (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0004" target="_blank">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0004</a>))<br /><br />* Fixed support for C API function `mysql_list_fields()', which was accidentally broken in 4.0.22 (Bug#6761)<br /><br />* Make `query_cache_wlock_invalidate' system variable visible in `SHOW VARIABLES' output. (Bug #7594)<br /><br />* Fixed a bug which caused `FROM_UNIXTIME()' function to return `NULL' for zero argument instead of the Epoch. (Bug #7515)<br /><br />* Now in datetime values two digit year is interpreted as year in 20th or 21st century even with zero month and day. (Bug #7297)<br /><br />* Fixed a bug in `QUOTE' function when used in conjunction with some other string functions. This lead to severe buffer overflow and server crashing. (Bug #7495)<br /><br />* InnoDB: Fixed a bug: 32-bit `mysqld' binaries built on HP-UX-11 did not work with `InnoDB' files greater than 2 GB in size. (Bug #6189)<br /><br />* Fixed that, when encountering a "disk full" or "quota exceeded" write error, `MyISAM' sometimes didn't sleep and retry the write, thus resulting in a corrupted table. (Bug #7714)<br /><br />* Fixed that a slave could crash after replicating many `ANALYZE TABLE', `OPTIMIZE TABLE', or `REPAIR TABLE' statements from the master. (Bug #6461, Bug #7658)<br /><br />* Fixed a bug where MySQL was allowing concurrent updates (inserts, deletes) to a table if binary logging is enabled. Changed to ensure that all updates are executed in a serialized fashion, because they are executed serialized when binlog is replayed. (Bug #7879)<br /><br />* Fixed a bug that caused the slave to stop on statements that produced an error on the master. (Bug #8412)<br /><br />* Documented problem with using `mysqldump' in 4.0.x to dump `TIMESTAMP(2)' and `TIMESTAMP(4)' column types.
