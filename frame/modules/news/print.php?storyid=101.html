        <h3>MySQL 6.0.2-alpha リリース！</h3>
        <small><b>投稿日時</b>&nbsp;2007-9-8 18:12:08 | <b>トピック：</b>&nbsp;MySQL</small><br /><br /></td></tr><tr valign="top" style="font:12px;"><td>MySQL 6.0.2-alpha がリリースされました。<br />これは 新しいストレージエンジン Falcon を含む、バージョン6.0系列のアルファー版リリースです。<br />主に Falcon に関する数多くの修正がなされているようです。<br /><br />Falcon については以下のURLを参考にしてください。<br /> <a href="http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/white-papers/falcon-getting-started.php" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/white-papers/falcon-getting-started.php</a><br /> <a href="http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/white-papers/storage-engines-falcon.php" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/white-papers/storage-engines-falcon.php</a><br /><br />----------<br />以下チェンジログ<br /><br />■機能の追加と変更(6.0.2-alpha)：<br /><br /> - 64-bit Windows support.<br /><br /> - Mac OS X (Intel) support has been added. Mac OS X is not currently a supported platform. To build on Mac OS X from the repository sources you must have the most recent versions of bison, automake, autoconf and libtool installed.<br /> There are known issues with the Falcon on Mac OS X build. (Bug#30564)<br /><br /> - Support for tablespaces.<br /><br /> - New performance settings, falcon_index_chill_threshold, falcon_record_chill_threshold, and falcon_log_windows.<br /><br /> - The Falcon record cache parameters have been altered. The falcon_max_record_memory and falcon_min_record_memory are no longer supported.<br /> Instead, falcon_record_memory_max, falcon_record_scavenge_threshold, falcon_record_scavenge_floor and falcon_inital_allocation parameters are now used to control the caching of records in memory within Falcon. See Section 3.1, 鼎onfiguration Parameters・ (Bug#30083)<br /> The option falcon_initial_allocation has been added to control the initial size of a Falcon tablespace on disk.<br /> The option falcon_disable_fsync has been added. If set to true, then the periodic fsync operation is disabled.<br /><br /><br />■バグ修正(6.0.2-alpha)：<br /><br /> - Renaming tables to or from Falcon tablespaces would raise an error. (Bug#22155)<br /><br /> - Some Falcon variables were marked as status variables. (Bug#29169)<br /><br /> - Under certain situations the Falcon tables and log could become corrupt and prevent recovery from a crashed version of the files. (Bug#28351)<br /><br /> - Updating a large table without an index would lock all the records during a transaction and unlock the records individually. (Bug#30124)<br /><br /> - Falcon would incorrectly allow creation of two tables with the same name but different case sensitivity, without raising an error, but treat the two tables as the same during further queries. (Bug#30210).<br /><br /> - When loading large datasets into a Falcon table mysqld could crash. An Out of memory error will now be raised in this situation. (Bug#30251)<br /><br /> - An assertion could be thrown during high number of concurrent updates of BLOB fields. (Bug#30463)<br /><br /> - Accessing an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table generated by Falcon, when Falcon has not been enabled would cause mysqld to crash. (Bug#29014)<br /><br /> - Falcon could occasionally report a problem with a duplicate key error during INSERT when inserting the same data into a unique column on two or more connections simultaneously. (Bug#29240)<br /><br /> - For debug builds, the server crashed when inserting a negated DECIMAL value of maximum precision (65 digits), such as for INSERT INTO ... SELECT -col_val ... (Bug#28810)<br /><br /> - Creating a tablespace with a unique name but using the same datafile as an existing tablespace results in the re-initialization of the tablespace and the loss of the data contained in it. Falcon will now report an error if you the datafile already exists. (Bug#29511)<br /><br /> - DELETE statements could cause a crash when many simultaneous threads are running. (Bug#26475)<br /><br /> - Using SELECT on a table that uses two INT columns with a single index would fail to return rows that queried both columns and complex comparison operators. (Bug#29319)<br /><br /> - Wide DECIMAL columns would show rounding errors during SELECT. (Bug#29201)<br /><br /> - Inserting into a table with a unique index simultaneously on two connections in a way that would cause a deadlock would cause MySQL to hang. The deadlock situation is now identified and an error will be raised. (Bug#29206)<br /><br /> - Accessing data within DECIMAL columns wider than 18 digits would cause a crash. (Bug#28725)<br /><br /> - Falcon would fail to build under Mac OS X/Intel. A preliminary patch is available to allow building under Mac OS X/Intel only (PowerPC support is not yet available). Note that Mac OS X/Intel is still an unsupported platform. (Bug#26466)<br /><br /> - Under certain situations, shutting down MySQL using mysqladmin could cause Falcon to corrupt the database tables and fail to restart properly. (Bug#26296)<br /><br /> - Queries could fail with a Can't find record in ... error. (Bug#26328)<br /><br /> - DECIMAL columns with large widths did not work, either during INSERT or SELECT. (Bug#26607).<br /><br /> - Renaming a database would raise error ERROR 1030 (HY000): Got error 157 from storage engine. (Bug#22182)<br /><br /> - Loading certain datasets through a direct import could cause index problems and crash. (Bug#26930)<br /><br /> - Inserting large numbers of identical columns into a table, followed by a SELECT or UPDATE could cause a hang or crash. (Bug#27277)<br /><br /> - The value for FALCON_SYSTEM_MEMORY_SUMMARY.TOTAL_SPACE in INFORMATION_SCHEMA would be reported incorrectly. (Bug#28197)<br /><br /> - Unique indexes on VARCHAR columns are not identified correctly. (Bug#28500)<br /><br /> - mysqld would crash after a high number of ALTER TABLE, INSERT and UPDATEstatements. (Bug#22154, Bug#28515)<br /><br /> - Searching for rows within a table with some non-western character sets would fail to return the right results if the SELECT relied on an index. (Bug#27697)<br /><br /> - Searches for accented characters in a UTF8 table fail if an index exists for the column. (Bug#26057)<br /><br /> - Searches using LIKE on a UTF8 table fail if the search relies an indexed column. (Bug#24921)<br /><br /> - Searches for data on a partial index for a column using the UTF8 character set would fail. (Bug#24858)<br /><br /> - Searches for data using exotic collation/character sets fail if the search relies on an indexed column. (Bug#23689)<br /><br /> - Inserting rows to a table with a unique index where the unique index value is identical on two separate connections would block the second transaction. (Bug#22847)<br /><br /> - Large inserts to a table within a single transaction trigger high memory usage and may ultimately crash.
