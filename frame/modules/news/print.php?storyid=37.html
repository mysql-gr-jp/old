        <h3>MySQL 5.0.3 リリース</h3>
        <small><b>投稿日時</b>&nbsp;2005-3-29 15:30:49 | <b>トピック：</b>&nbsp;MySQL</small><br /><br /></td></tr><tr valign="top" style="font:12px;"><td>MySQL 5.0.3 がリリースされました。<br />いろいろかわっています。<br />たくさんありますので、詳しくはチェンジログをご覧下さい。<br /><br />以下チェンジログ<br />-------<br /><br />Changes in release 5.0.3:<br /><br />■機能の追加と変更：<br /><br />- New privilege CREATE USER was added.<br /><br />- Security improvement: The server creates `.frm', `.MYD', `.MYI', `.MRG', `.ISD', and `.ISM' table files only if a file with the same name does not already exist. (Thanks to Stefano Di Paola <<a href="mailto:stefano.dipaola@wisec.it">stefano.dipaola@wisec.it</a>> for finding and informing us about this issue.)<br /><br />- Security improvement: User-defined functions should have at least one symbol defined in addition to the xxx symbol that corresponds to the main  xxx()  function.  These  auxiliary symbols correspond to the xxx_init(),  xxx_deinit(), xxx_reset(), xxx_clear(), and xxx_add() functions. mysqld by default no longer loads UDFs unless they have at least one auxiliary symbol defined in addition to the main symbol. The --allow-suspicious-udfs option controls whether UDFs that have only an xxx symbol can be loaded. By default, the option is off. mysqld also checks UDF filenames when it reads them from the mysql.func table and rejects those that contain directory pathname separator characters. (It already checked names as given in CREATE FUNCTION statements.) See section 25.2.3.1 UDF Calling Sequences for simple functions, section 25.2.3.2 UDF Calling Sequences for aggregate functions, and section 25.2.3.6 User-defined Function Security Precautions.  (Thanks to Stefano Di Paola <<a href="mailto:stefano.dipaola@wisec.it">stefano.dipaola@wisec.it</a>> for finding and informing us about this issue.)<br /><br />- Support for the ISAM storage engine has been removed. If you have ISAM tables,  you  should  convert  them  before upgrading. See section 2.10.1 Upgrading from Version 4.1 to 5.0.<br /><br />- Support for RAID options in MyISAM tables has been removed. If you have tables that use these options, you should convert them before upgrading.  See section 2.10.1 Upgrading from Version 4.1 to 5.0.<br /><br />- Added support for AVG(DISTINCT).<br /><br />- ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY no longer is included in the ANSI composite SQL mode. (Bug #8510)<br /><br />- mysqld_safe will create the directory where the UNIX socket file is to be located if the directory does not exist. This applies only to the last component of the directory pathname. (Bug #8513)<br /><br />- The coercibility for the return value of functions such as USER() or VERSION() now is ``system constant'' rather than ``implicit.'' This makes  these  functions  more coercible than column values so that comparisons  of the two do not result in Illegal mix of collations errors. COERCIBILITY() was modified to accommodate this new coercibility value. See section 12.8.3 Information Functions.<br /><br />- User  variable coercibility has been changed from ``coercible'' to ``implicit.'' That is, user variables have the same coercibility as column values.<br /><br />- Boolean  full-text phrase searching now requires only that matches contain exactly the same words as the phrase and in the same order.  Non-word characters no longer need match exactly.<br /><br />- CHECKSUM TABLE returns a warning for non-existing tables. The checksum value remains NULL as before. (Bug #8256)<br /><br />- The server now includes a timestamp in the Ready for connections message that is written to the error log at startup. (Bug #8444)<br /><br />- Added SQL_NOTES session variable to cause Note-level warnings not to be recorded. (Bug #6662)<br /><br />- Allowed the service-installation command for Windows servers to specify a single option other than --defaults-file following the service name.  This is for compatibility with MySQL 4.1. (Bug #7856)<br /><br />- InnoDB: Upgrading from 4.1: The sorting order for end-space in TEXT columns for InnoDB tables has changed. Starting from 5.0.3, InnoDB compares  TEXT  columns  as space-padded at the end. If you have a non-unique index on a TEXT column, you should run CHECK TABLE on it, and run OPTIMIZE TABLE if the check reports errors. If you have a UNIQUE INDEX on a TEXT column, you should rebuild the table with OPTIMIZE TABLE.<br /><br />- InnoDB: Commit after every 10,000 copied rows when executing ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX or OPTIMIZE TABLE. This makes it much faster to recover from an aborted operation.<br /><br />- Added  VAR_POP()  and STDDEV_POP() as standard SQL aliases for the VARIANCE() and STDDEV() functions that compute population variance and standard deviation. Added new VAR_SAMP() and STDDEV_SAMP() functions to compute sample variance and standard deviation. (Bug #3190)<br /><br />- Fixed a problem with out-of-order packets being sent (ERROR after OK or EOF) following a KILL QUERY statement. (Bug #6804)<br /><br />- Retrieving from a view defined as a SELECT that mixed UNION ALL and UNION DISTINCT resulted in a different result than retrieving from the original SELECT. (Bug #6565)<br /><br />- Fixed a problem with non-optimal index_merge query execution plans being chosen on IRIX. (Bug #8578)<br /><br />- BIT in column definitions now is a distinct data type; it no longer is treated as a synonym for TINYINT(1).<br /><br />- Bit-field values can be written using b'value' notation. value is a binary value written using 0s and 1s.<br /><br />- From the Windows distribution, predefined accounts without passwords for remote users ("root@%", "@%") were removed (other distributions never had them).<br /><br />- Added mysql_library_init() and mysql_library_end() as synonyms for the mysql_server_init()   and   mysql_server_end()  C  API functions.  mysql_library_init() and mysql_library_end() are #define symbols, but the  names  more  clearly indicate that they should be called when beginning and ending use of a MySQL C API library no matter whether the application uses libmysqlclient or libmysqld. (Bug #6149)<br /><br />- SHOW COLUMNS now displays NO rather than blank in the Null output column if the corresponding table column cannot be NULL.<br /><br />- Changed XML format for mysql from <col_name>col_value</col_name> to <field name="col_name">col_value</field> to allow for proper encoding of column names that are not legal as element names. (Bug #7811)<br /><br />- Added --innodb-checksums and --innodb-doublewrite options for mysqld.<br /><br />- Added --large-pages option for mysqld.<br /><br />- Added multi_read_range system variable.<br /><br />- SHOW  DATABASES,  SHOW TABLES, SHOW COLUMNS, and so forth display information about the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database. Also, several SHOW statements now accept a WHERE clause specifying which output rows to display.  See  section 21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA Information Database.<br /><br />- Added the CREATE ROUTINE and ALTER ROUTINE privileges, and made the EXECUTE privilege operational.<br /><br />- InnoDB: Corrected a bug in the crash recovery of ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT tables that caused corruption. (Bug #7973) There may still be bugs in the crash recovery, especially in COMPACT tables.<br /><br />- When the MyISAM storage engine detects corruption of a MyISAM table, a message describing the problem now is written to the error log.<br /><br />- InnoDB: When MySQL/InnoDB is compiled on Mac OS X 10.2 or earlier, detect the operating system version at run time and use the fcntl() file flush method on Mac OS X versions 10.3 and later. Apple had disabled fsync() in Mac OS X for internal disk drives, which caused corruption at power outages.<br /><br />- InnoDB: Implemented fast TRUNCATE TABLE. The old approach (deleting rows one by one) may be used if the table is being referenced by foreign keys. (Bug #7150)<br /><br />- Added cp932 (SJIS for Windows Japanese) and eucjpms (UJIS for Windows Japanese) character sets.<br /><br />- Added several InnoDB status variables. See section 5.2.4 Server Status Variables.<br /><br />- Added the FEDERATED storage engine. See section 14.6 The FEDERATED Storage Engine.<br /><br />- SHOW CREATE TABLE now uses USING index_type rather than TYPE index_type to specify an index type. (Bug #7233)<br /><br />- InnoDB now supports a fast TRUNCATE TABLE. One visible change from this is that auto-increment values for this table are reset on TRUNCATE.<br /><br />- Added an error member to the MYSQL_BIND data structure that is used in the C API for prepared statements. This member is used for reporting data truncation errors. Truncation reporting is enabled via the new MYSQL_REPORT_DATA_TRUNCATION  option for the mysql_options() C API function.<br /><br />- API change: the reconnect flag in the MYSQL structure is now set to 0 by mysql_real_connect(). Only those client programs which didn't explicitly set this flag to 0 or 1 after mysql_real_connect() experience a change.  Having automatic reconnection enabled by default was considered too dangerous (after reconnection, table locks, temporary tables, user and session variables are lost).<br /><br />- FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK is now killable while it's waiting for running COMMIT statements to finish.<br /><br />- MEMORY (HEAP) can have VARCHAR() fields.<br /><br />- VARCHAR columns now remember end space. A VARCHAR() column can now contain up to 65535 bytes. For more details, see section D.1 Changes in release 5.0.x (Development). If the table handler doesn't support the new VARCHAR type, then it's converted to a CHAR column.  Currently this happens for NDB and InnoDB tables.<br /><br />- InnoDB: Introduced a compact record format that does not store the number of columns or the lengths of fixed-size columns. The old format can be requested by specifying ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT. The new format (ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT) is the default.<br /><br />- InnoDB: Setting the initial AUTO_INCREMENT value for an InnoDB table using CREATE TABLE ... AUTO_INCREMENT = n now works, and ALTER TABLE ...  AUTO_INCREMENT = n resets the current value.<br /><br />- Seconds_Behind_Master is NULL (which means ``unknown'') if the slave SQL thread is not running, or if the slave I/O thread is not running or not connected to master. It is zero if the SQL thread has caught up to the I/O thread. It no longer grows indefinitely if the master is idle.<br /><br />- The MySQL server aborts immediately instead of simply issuing a warning if it is started with the --log-bin option but cannot initialize the binary log at startup (that is, an error occurs when writing to the binary log file or binary log index file).<br /><br />- The binary log file and binary log index file now are handled the same way as MyISAM tables when there is a ``disk full'' or ``quota exceeded'' error. See section A.4.3 How MySQL Handles a Full Disk.<br /><br />- The MySQL server now aborts when started with option --log-bin-index and without --log-bin, and when started with --log-slave-updates and without --log-bin.<br /><br />- If the MySQL server is started without an argument to --log-bin and without --log-bin-index, thus not providing a name for the binary log index file, a warning is issued because MySQL falls back to using the hostname for that name, and this is prone to replication issues if the server's hostname's gets changed later. See section 1.5.7.4 Open Bugs and Design Deficiencies in MySQL.<br /><br />- Added account-specific MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS limit, which allows you to specify the maximum number of concurrent connections for the account.  Also, all limited resources now are counted per account  (instead of being  counted  per  user  +  host pair as it was before). Use the --old-style-user-limits option to get the old  behavior.<br /><br />- InnoDB: A shared record lock (LOCK_REC_NOT_GAP) is now taken for a matching record in the foreign key check because inserts can be allowed into gaps.<br /><br />- InnoDB: Relaxed locking in INSERT...SELECT, single table UPDATE...SELECT and single table DELETE...SELECT clauses     when innobase_locks_unsafe_for_binlog is used and isolation level of the transaction is not serializable. InnoDB uses consistent read in these cases for a selected table.<br /><br />- Added a new global system variable slave_transaction_retries: if the replication slave SQL thread fails to execute a transaction because of an InnoDB deadlock or exceeded InnoDB's innodb_lock_wait_timeout or NDBCluster's TransactionDeadlockDetectionTimeout or TransactionInactiveTimeout, it automatically retries slave_transaction_retries times before stopping with an error. The default is 10. (Bug #8325)<br /><br />- When a client releases a user-level lock, DO RELEASE_LOCK() will  not be written to the binary log anymore (this makes the binary log  smaller); as a counterpart, the slave does not actually take the  lock when it executes GET_LOCK(). This is mainly an optimization  and should not affect existing setups. (Bug #7998)<br /><br />- The way the character set information is stored into the binary  log was changed, so that it's now possible to have a replication  master and slave running with different global character sets. A  drawback is that replication from 5.0.3 masters to pre-5.0.3 slaves is impossible.<br /><br />- The LOAD DATA statement was extended to support user variables in the target column list, and an optional SET clause. Now one can perform some transformations on data after they have been read and before they are inserted into the table. For example:<br />  LOAD DATA INFILE 'file.txt' INTO TABLE t1 (column1, @var1) SET column2 = @var1/100;<br />  Also, replication of LOAD DATA was changed, so you can't replicate such statements from a 5.0.3 master to pre-5.0.3 slaves.<br /><br /><br /><br />■バグ修正：<br /><br />- mysql_fix_privilege_tables now fixes that the mysql privilege tables can be used in MySQL 4.1. This allows one to easily downgrade to 4.1 or run MySQL 5.0 and 4.1 with the same privilege files for testing purposes.<br /><br />- Fixed  bug  creating user with GRANT fails with password but works without, (Bug #7905)<br /><br />- mysqldump misinterpreted `_' and `%' characters in the names of tables to be dumped as wildcard characters. (Bug #9123)<br /><br />- The definition of the enumeration-valued sql_mode column of the mysql.proc table was missing some of the current allowable SQL modes, so stored routines would not necessarily execute with the SQL mode in effect at the time of routine definition. (Bug #8902)<br /><br />- REPAIR TABLE did not invalidate query results in the query cache that were generated from the table. (Bug #8480)<br /><br />- In strict or traditional SQL mode, too-long string values assigned to string columns (CHAR, VARCHAR, BINARY, VARBINARY, TEXT, or BLOB) were correctly truncated, but the server returned an SQLSTATE value of 01000 (should be 22001). (Bug #6999, Bug #9029)<br /><br />- Stored functions that used cursors could return incorrect results. (Bug #8386)<br /><br />- AES_DECRYPT(col_name,key) could fail to return NULL for invalid values in col_name, if col_name was declared as NOT NULL. (Bug #8669)<br /><br />- Ordering by unsigned expression (more complex than a column reference) was treating the value as signed, producing incorrectly sorted results.  (Bug #7425)<br /><br />- HAVING was treating unsigned columns as signed. (Bug #7425)<br /><br />- Fixed a problem with boolean full-text searches on utf8 columns where a double quote in the search string caused a server crash. (Bug #8351)<br /><br />- For a query with both GROUP BY and COUNT(DISTINCT) clauses and a FROM clause  with  a subquery, NULL was returned for any VARCHAR column selected by the subquery. (Bug #8218)<br /><br />- Fixed a bug in TRUNCATE, which did not work within stored procedures. A workaround has been made so that within stored procedures, TRUNCATE is executed like DELETE. This was necessary because TRUNCATE is implicitly locking tables. (Bug #8850)<br /><br />- Fixed an optimizer bug that caused incorrectly ordered result from a query that used a FULLTEXT index to retrieve rows and there was another index that was usable for ORDER BY. For such a query, EXPLAIN showed fulltext join type, but regular (not FULLTEXT) index in the Key column.  (Bug #6635)<br /><br />- If SELECT DISTINCT named an index column multiple times in the select list, the server tried to access different key fields for each instance of the column, which could result in a crash. (Bug #8532)<br /><br />- For  a  stored function that refers to a given table, invoking the function while selecting from the same table resulted in a server crash.  (Bug #8405)<br /><br />- Comparison  of a DECIMAL column containing NULL to a subquery that produced DECIMAL values resulted in a server crash. (Bug #8397)<br /><br />- The  --set-character-set  option  for  myisamchk  was  changed to --set-collation. The value needed for specifying how to sort indexes is a collation name, not a character set name. (Bug #8349)<br /><br />- Hostname  matching  didn't  work  if  a  netmask was specified for table-specific privileges. (Bug #3309)<br /><br />- Corruption of MyISAM table indexes could occur with TRUNCATE TABLE if the table had already been opened. For example, this was possible if the table had been opened implicitly by selecting from a MERGE table that mapped to the MyISAM table. The server now issues an error message for TRUNCATE TABLE under these conditions. (Bug #8306)<br /><br />- Setting the connection collation to a value different from the server collation followed by a CREATE TABLE statement that included a quoted default value resulted in a server crash. (Bug #8235)<br /><br />- Fixed handling of table-name matching in mysqlhotcopy to accommodate DBD::mysql 2.9003 and up (which implement identifier quoting). (Bug #8136)<br /><br />- Selecting from a view defined as a join caused a server crash if the query cache was enabled. (Bug #8054)<br /><br />- Results in the query cache generated from a view were not properly invalidated after ALTER VIEW or DROP VIEW on that view. (Bug #8050)<br /><br />- FOUND_ROWS()   returned   an   incorrect   value  after  a SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS DISTINCT statement that selected constants and included GROUP BY and LIMIT clauses. (Bug #7945)<br /><br />- Selecting from an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table combined with a subselect on an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table caused an error with the message Table tbl_name is corrupted. (Bug #8164)<br /><br />- Fixed a problem with equality propagation optimization for prepared statements  and  stored procedures that caused a server crash upon re-execution of the prepared statement or stored procedure. (Bug #8115, Bug #8849)<br /><br />- LEFT OUTER JOIN between an empty base table and a view on an empty base table caused a server crash. (Bug #7433)<br /><br />- Use of GROUP_CONCAT() in the select list when selecting from a view caused a server crash. (Bug #7116)<br /><br />- Use of a view in a correlated subquery that contains HAVING but no GROUP BY caused a server crash. (Bug #6894)<br /><br />- Handling by mysql_list_fields() of references to stored functions within views was incorrect and could result in a server crash. (Bug #6814)<br /><br />- mysqldump now avoids writing SET NAMES to the dump output if the server is older than version 4.1 and would not understand that statement. (Bug #7997)<br /><br />- Fixed problems when selecting from a view that had an EXISTS or NOT EXISTS subquery. Selecting columns by name caused a server crash. With SELECT *, a crash did not occur, but columns in outer query were not resolved properly. (Bug #6394)<br /><br />- DDL statements for views were not being written to the binary log (and thus not subject to replication). (Bug #4838)<br /><br />- The CHAR() function was not ignoring NULL arguments, contrary to the documentation. (Bug #6317)<br /><br />- Creating a table using a name containing a character that is illegal in character_set_client resulted in the character being stripped from the name and no error. The character now is considered an error. (Bug #8041)<br /><br />- Fixed a problem with the Cyrillic letters I and SHORT I being treated the same by the utf8_general_ci collation. (Bug #8385)<br /><br />- Some INFORMATION_SCHEMA columns that contained catalog identifiers were of  type LONGTEXT. These were changed to VARCHAR(N, where N is the appropriate maximum identifier length. (Bug #7215)<br /><br />- Some INFORMATION_SCHEMA columns that contained timestamp values were of type VARBINARY. These were changed to TIMESTAMP. (Bug #7217)<br /><br />- An expression that tested a case-insensitive character column against string constants that differed in lettercase could fail because the constants were treated as having a binary collation. (For example, WHERE city='London' AND city='london' could fail.) (Bug #7098, Bug #8690)<br /><br />- The output of the STATUS (\s) command in mysql had the values for the server and client character sets reversed. (Bug #7571)<br /><br />- If the slave was running with --replicate-*-table options which excluded one temporary table and included another, and the two tables were used in a single DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS statement, as the ones the master  automatically  writes  to  its binary  log  upon client's disconnection when client has not explicitly dropped these, the slave could forget to delete the included replicated temporary table. Only the slave needs to be upgraded. (Bug #8055)<br /><br />- When setting integer system variables to a negative value with SET VARIABLES, the value was treated as a positive value modulo 2^32. (Bug #6958)<br /><br />- Corrected a problem with references to DUAL where statements such as SELECT 1 AS a FROM DUAL would succeed but statements such as SELECT 1 AS a FROM DUAL LIMIT 1 would fail. (Bug #8023)<br /><br />- Fixed a server crash caused by DELETE FROM tbl_name ... WHERE ... ORDER BY tbl_name.col_name when the ORDER BY column was qualified with the table name. (Bug #8392)<br /><br />- Fixed a bug in MATCH ... AGAINST in natural language mode that could cause  a server crash if the FULLTEXT index was not used in a join (EXPLAIN did not show fulltext join mode) and the search query matched no rows in the table (Bug #8522).<br /><br />- InnoDB: Honor the --tmpdir startup option when creating temporary files.  Previously, InnoDB temporary files were always created in the temporary directory of the operating system. On Netware, InnoDB will continue to ignore --tmpdir. (Bug #5822)<br /><br />- Platform and architecture information in version information produced for --version option on Windows was always Win95/Win98 (i32). More accurately determine platform as Win32 or Win64 for 32-bit or 64-bit Windows, and architecture as ia32 for x86, ia64 for Itanium, and axp for Alpha. (Bug #4445)<br /><br />- If multiple semicolon-separated statements were received in a single packet, they were written to the binary log as a single event rather than  as  separate per-statement events. For a server serving as a replication master, this caused replication to fail when the event was sent to slave servers. (Bug #8436)<br /><br />- Fixed LOAD INDEX statement to actually load index in memory. (Bug #8452)<br /><br />- Fixed a failure of multiple-table updates to replicate properly on slave servers when --replicate-*-table options had been specified. (Bug #7011)<br /><br />- Fixed failure of CREATE TABLE ... LIKE Windows when the source or destination table was located in a symlinked database directory. (Bug #6607)<br /><br />- With lower_case_table_names set to 1, mysqldump on Windows could<br />  write the  same  table  name  in  different lettercase for<br />  different SQL statements. Fixed so that consistent lettercase is<br />  used. (Bug #5185)<br /><br />- mysqld_safe now understands the --help option. Previously, it ignored the option and attempted to start the server anyway. (Bug #7931)<br /><br />- Fixed  problem  in  NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode for strings that contained both the string quoting character and backslash. (Bug #6368)<br /><br />- Fixed some portability issues with overflow in floating point values.<br /><br />- Prepared statements now gives warnings on prepare.<br /><br />- Fixed bug in prepared statements with SUM(DISTINCT...).<br /><br />- Fixed bug in prepared statements with OUTER JOIN.<br /><br />- Fixed a bug in CONV() function returning unsigned BIGINT number (third argument is positive, and return value does not fit in 32 bits). (Bug #7751)<br /><br />- Fixed a failure of the IN() operator to return correct result if all values in the list were constants and some of them were using substring functions, for example, LEFT(), RIGHT(), or MID(). (Bug #7716)<br /><br />- Fixed a crash in CONVERT_TZ() function when its second or third argument was from a const table (see section 7.2.1 EXPLAIN Syntax (Get Information About a SELECT)). (Bug #7705)<br /><br />- Fixed a problem with calculation of number of columns in row comparison against subquery. (Bug #8020)<br /><br />- Fixed erroneous output resulting from SELECT DISTINCT combined with a subquery and GROUP BY. (Bug #7946)<br /><br />- Fixed server crash in comparing a nested row expression (for example row(1,(2,3))) with a subquery. (Bug #8022)<br /><br />- Fixed server crash resulting from certain correlated subqueries with forward references (references to an alias defined later in the outer query). (Bug #8025)<br /><br />- Fixed server crash resulting from re-execution of prepared statements containing subqueries. (Bug #8125)<br /><br />- Fixed a bug where ALTER TABLE improperly would accept an index on a TIMESTAMP column that CREATE TABLE would reject. (Bug #7884)<br /><br />- SHOW CREATE TABLE now reports ENGINE=MEMORY rather than ENGINE=HEAP for a MEMORY table (unless the MYSQL323 SQL mode is enabled). (Bug #6659)<br /><br />- Fixed a bug where the use of GROUP_CONCAT() with HAVING caused a server crash. (Bug #7769)<br /><br />- Fixed a bug where comparing the result of a subquery to a non-existent column caused a server crash on Windows. (Bug #7885)<br /><br />- Fixed a bug in a combination of -not and trunc* operators of full-text search. Using more than one truncated negative search term, was causing empty result set.<br /><br />- InnoDB: Corrected the handling of trailing spaces in the ucs2 character set. (Bug #7350, Bug #8771)<br /><br />- InnoDB: Use native tmpfile() function on Netware. All InnoDB temporary files are created under sys:\tmp. Previously, InnoDB temporary files were never deleted on Netware.<br /><br />- Fixed a bug in max_heap_table_size handling, that resulted in Table is full error when the table was still smaller than the limit. (Bug #7791).<br /><br />- Fixed a symlink vulnerability in the mysqlaccess script. Reported by Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pena and Debian Security Audit Team. (CAN-2005-0004)<br /><br />- Fixed  a bug that caused server crash if some error occured during filling of temporary table created for derived table or view handling.  (Bug #7413)<br /><br />- Fixed a bug which caused server crash if query containing CONVERT_TZ() function with constant arguments was prepared. (Bug #6849)<br /><br />- Prevent adding CREATE TABLE .. SELECT query to the binary log when the insertion of new records partially failed. (Bug #6682)<br /><br />- Fixed a bug which caused a crash when only the slave I/O thread was stopped and started. (Bug #6148)<br /><br />- Giving mysqld a SIGHUP caused it to crash.<br /><br />- Changed semantics of CREATE/ALTER/DROP DATABASE statements so that replication of CREATE DATABASE is possible when using --binlog-do-db and --binlog-ignore-db. (Bug #6391)<br /><br />- A sequence of BEGIN (or SET AUTOCOMMIT=0), FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK, transactional update, COMMIT, FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK could hang the connection forever and possibly the MySQL server itself. This happened for example when running the innobackup script several times. (Bug #6732)<br /><br />- mysqlbinlog did not print SET PSEUDO_THREAD_ID statements in front of LOAD  DATA INFILE statements inserting into temporary tables, thus causing potential problems when rolling forward these statements after restoring a backup. (Bug #6671)<br /><br />- InnoDB:  Fixed  a  bug  no error message for ALTER with InnoDB and AUTO_INCREMENT    (Bug   #7061).   InnoDB   now   supports ALTER TABLE...AUTO_INCREMENT = x query to set auto increment value for a table.<br /><br />- Made the MySQL server accept executing SHOW CREATE DATABASE even if the connection has an open transaction or locked tables; refusing it made mysqldump --single-transaction sometimes fail to print a complete CREATE DATABASE statement for some dumped databases. (Bug #7358)<br /><br />- Fixed that, when encountering a ``disk full'' or ``quota exceeded'' write error, MyISAM sometimes didn't sleep and retry the write, thus resulting in a corrupted table. (Bug #7714)<br /><br />- Fixed that --expire-log-days was not honored if using only transactions.  (Bug #7236)<br /><br />- Fixed that a slave could crash after replicating many ANALYZE TABLE, OPTIMIZE TABLE, or REPAIR TABLE statements from the master. (Bug #6461, Bug #7658)<br /><br />- mysqlbinlog  forgot to add backquotes around the collation of user variables (causing later parsing problems as BINARY is a reserved word).  (Bug #7793)<br /><br />- Ensured  that  mysqldump --single-transaction sets its transaction isolation level to REPEATABLE READ before proceeding (otherwise if the MySQL server was configured to run with a default isolation level lower than REPEATABLE READ it could give an inconsistent dump). (Bug #7850)<br /><br />- Fixed that when using the RPAD() function (or any function adding spaces to the right) in a query that had to be resolved by using a temporary table, all resulting strings had rightmost spaces removed (i.e. RPAD() did not work) (Bug #4048)<br /><br />- Fixed that a 5.0.3 slave can connect to a master < 3.23.50 without hanging (the reason for the hang is a bug in these quite old masters -- SELECT @@unknown_var hangs them -- which was fixed in MySQL 3.23.50).  (Bug #7965)<br /><br />- InnoDB: Fixed a deadlock without any locking, simple select and update (Bug #7975). InnoDB now takes an exclusive lock when INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE is checking duplicate keys.<br /><br />- Fixed  a bug where MySQL was allowing concurrent updates (inserts, deletes) to a table if binary logging is enabled. Changed to ensure that all updates are executed in a serialized fashion, because they are executed serialized when binlog is replayed. (Bug #7879)<br /><br />- Fixed a rare race condition which could lead to FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK hanging. (Bug #8682)<br /><br />- Fixed a bug that caused the slave to stop on statements that produced an error on the master. (Bug #8412)<br /><br /><br /></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
