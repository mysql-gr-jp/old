    <p class="itemText">MySQL 5.0.41 (Community 版) がリリースされました。<br /><br />5.0.33（１月）<br />5.0.37（3月）<br />5.0.41（5月）<br /><br />・・・・とようやくリリースペースが波に乗ってきたという印象を受けますね。<br />MySQL 5.0.41 では、約170項目の修正がなされています。<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/" target="_blank">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/</a><br /><br />からダウンロードできます。<br /><br /><br />--------------<br />以下チェンジログ：<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />MySQL Community Server 5.0.41,<br /><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/" target="_blank">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/</a><br /><br /><br />■機能の追加と変更(5.0.41):<br />- If you use SSL for a client connection, you can tell the client not to authenticate the server certificate by specifying neither --ssl-ca nor --ssl-capath. The server still verifies the client according to any applicable requirements established via GRANT statements for the client, and it still uses any --ssl-ca/--ssl-capath values that were passed to server at startup time. (Bug#25309: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25309" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25309</a>)<br /><br />- Prefix lengths for columns in SPATIAL indexes are no longer displayed in SHOW CREATE TABLE output. mysqldump uses that statement, so if a table with SPATIAL indexes containing prefixed columns is dumped and reloaded, the index is created with no prefixes. (The full column width of each column is indexed.) (Bug#26794: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26794" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26794</a>)<br /><br />- The output of mysql --xml and mysqldump --xml now includes a valid XML namespace. (Bug#25946: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25946" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25946</a>)<br /><br />- The mysql_create_system_tables script was removed because mysql_install_db no longer uses it in MySQL 5.0.<br /><br />- The syntax for index hints has been extended to enable explicit specification that the hint applies only to join processing. See Section 13.2.7.2, "Index Hint Syntax." (Bug#21174: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/21174" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/21174</a>)<br /><br />- Binary distributions for some platforms did not include shared libraries; now shared libraries are shipped for all platforms except AIX 5.2 64-bit. (Bug#13450: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/13450" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/13450</a>, Bug#16520: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/16520" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/16520</a>, Bug#26767: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26767" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26767</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: It is now possible to restore selected databases or tables using ndb_restore. (Bug#26899: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26899" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26899</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: Several options have been added for use with ndb_restore --print_data to facilitate the creation of data dump files. (Bug#26900: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26900" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26900</a>)<br /><br />- To satisfy different user requirements, we provide several servers. mysqld is an optimized server that is a smaller, faster binary. Each package now also includes mysqld-debug, which is compiled with debugging support but is otherwise configured identically to the non-debug server.<br /><br />- Added the --secure-file-priv option for mysql-test-run.pl, which limits the effect of the load_file command for mysqltest and for the LOAD DATA and SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE statements to work with files in a given directory. (Bug#18628: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/18628" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/18628</a>)<br /><br />- Added the hostname system variable, which the server sets at startup to the server hostname.<br /><br />- The server now includes a timestamp in error messages that are logged as a result of unhandled signals (such as mysqld got signal 11 messages). (Bug#24878: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/24878" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/24878</a>)<br /><br /><br /><br />■バグ修正(5.0.41):<br />- The patches for Bug#19370: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/19370" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/19370</a> and Bug#21789: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/21789" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/21789</a> were reverted.<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: NDB tables having MEDIUMINT AUTO_INCREMENT columns were not restored correctly by ndb_restore, causing spurious duplicate key errors. This issue did not affect TINYINT, INT, or BIGINT columns with AUTO_INCREMENT. (Bug#27775: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27775" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27775</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: NDB tables with indexes whose names contained space characters were not restored correctly by ndb_restore (the index names were truncated). (Bug#27758: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27758" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27758</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: Some queries that updated multiple tables were not backed up correctly. (Bug#27748: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27748" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27748</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: Joins on multiple tables containing BLOB columns could cause data nodes run out of memory, and to crash with the error NdbObjectIdMap::expand unable to expand. (Bug#26176: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26176" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26176</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster (APIs): Using NdbBlob::writeData() to write data in the middle of an existing blob value (that is, updating the value) could overwrite some data past the end of the data to be changed. (Bug#27018: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27018" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27018</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: Under certain rare circumstances, DROP TABLE or TRUNCATE of an NDB table could cause a node failure or forced cluster shutdown. (Bug#27581: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27581" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27581</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: Memory usage of a mysqld process grew even while idle. (Bug#27560: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27560" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27560</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: In some cases, AFTER UPDATE and AFTER DELETE triggers on NDB tables that referenced subject table did not see the results of operation which caused invocation of the trigger, but rather saw the row as it was prior to the update or delete operation. This was most noticeable when an update operation used a subquery to obtain the rows to be updated. An example would be UPDATE tbl1 SET col2 = val1 WHERE tbl1.col1 IN (SELECT col3 FROM tbl2 WHERE c4 = val2) where there was an AFTER UPDATE trigger on table tbl1. In such cases, the trigger would fail to execute. The problem occurred because the actual update or delete operations were deferred to be able to perform them later as one batch. The fix for this bug solves the problem by disabling this optimization for a given update or delete if the table has an AFTER trigger defined for this operation. (Bug#26242: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26242" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26242</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: Condition pushdown did not work with prepared statements. (Bug#26225: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26225" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26225</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: When trying to create tables on an SQL node not connected to the cluster, a misleading error message Table 'tbl_name' already exists was generated. The error now generated is Could not connect to storage engine. (Bug#18676: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/18676" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/18676</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: Error messages displayed when running in single user mode were inconsistent. (Bug#27021: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27021" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27021</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: On Solaris, the value of an NDB table column declared as BIT(33) was always displayed as 0. (Bug#26986: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26986" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26986</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: The output from ndb_restore --print_data was incorrect for a backup made of a database containing tables with TINYINT or SMALLINT columns. (Bug#26740: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26740" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26740</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: After entering single user mode it was not possible to alter non-NDB tables on any SQL nodes other than the one having sole access to the cluster. (Bug#25275: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25275" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25275</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: The failure of a data node while restarting could cause other data nodes to hang or crash. (Bug#27003: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27003" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27003</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: The management client command node_id STATUS displayed the message Node node_id: not connected when node_id was not the node ID of a data node. (Bug#21715: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/21715" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/21715</a>) Note: The ALL STATUS command in the cluster management client still displays status information for data nodes only. This is by design. See Section 15.7.2, "Commands in the MySQL Cluster Management Client," for more information.<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: It was not possible to set LockPagesInMainMemory equal to 0. (Bug#27291: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27291" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27291</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: A race condition could sometimes occur if the node acting as master failed while node IDs were still being allocated during startup. (Bug#27286: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27286" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27286</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: When a data node was taking over as the master node, a race condition could sometimes occur as the node was assuming responsibility for handling of global checkpoints. (Bug#27283: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27283" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27283</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: mysqld processes would sometimes crash under high load. (Bug#26825: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26825" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26825</a>)<br /><br />- NDB Cluster: Some values of MaxNoOfTables caused the error Job buffer congestion to occur. (Bug#19378: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/19378" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/19378</a>)<br /><br />- Some equi-joins containing a WHERE clause that included a NOT IN subquery caused a server crash. (Bug#27870: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27870" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27870</a>)<br /><br />- Windows binaries contained no debug symbol file. Now .map and .pdb files are included in 32-bit builds for mysqld-nt.exe, mysqld-debug.exe, and mysqlmanager.exe. (Bug#26893: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26893" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26893</a>)<br /><br />- The test for the MYSQL_OPT_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT option for mysql_options() was performed incorrectly. Also changed as a result of this bugfix: The arg option for the mysql_options() C API function was changed from char * to void *. (Bug#24121: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/24121" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/24121</a>)<br /><br />- The range optimizer could consume a combinatorial amount of memory for certain classes of WHERE clauses. (Bug#26624: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26624" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26624</a>)<br /><br />- Conversion of DATETIME values in numeric contexts sometimes did not produce a double (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.uuuuuu) value. (Bug#16546: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/16546" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/16546</a>)<br /><br />- Passing nested row expressions with different structures to an IN predicate caused a server crash. (Bug#27484: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27484" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27484</a>)<br /><br />- SELECT DISTINCT could return incorrect results if the select list contained duplicated columns. (Bug#27659: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27659" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27659</a>)<br /><br />- A subquery could get incorrect values for references to outer query columns when it contained aggregate functions that were aggregated in outer context. (Bug#27321: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27321" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27321</a>)<br /><br />- In some cases, the optimizer preferred a range or full index scan access method over lookup access methods when the latter were much cheaper. (Bug#19372: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/19372" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/19372</a>)<br /><br />- Duplicates were not properly identified among (potentially) long strings used as arguments for GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT). (Bug#26815: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26815" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26815</a>)<br /><br />- For InnoDB, fixed consistent-read behavior of the first read statement, if the read was served from the query cache, for the READ COMMITTED isolation level. (Bug#21409: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/21409" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/21409</a>)<br /><br />- The decimal.h header file was incorrectly omitted from binary distributions. (Bug#27456: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27456" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27456</a>)<br /><br />- Duplicate members in SET definitions were not detected. Now they result in a warning; if strict SQL mode is enabled, an error occurs instead. (Bug#27069: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27069" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27069</a>)<br /><br />- For INSERT INTO ... SELECT where index searches used column prefixes, insert errors could occur when key value type conversion was done. (Bug#26207: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26207" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26207</a>)<br /><br />- For SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS, the LATEST DEADLOCK INFORMATION was not always cleared properly. (Bug#25494: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25494" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25494</a>)<br /><br />- mysqldump could crash or exhibit incorrect behavior when some options were given very long values, such as --fields-terminated-by="some very long string". The code has been cleaned up to remove a number of fixed-sized buffers and to be more careful about error conditions in memory allocation. (Bug#26346: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26346" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26346</a>)<br /><br />- Setting a column to NOT NULL with an ON DELETE SET NULL clause foreign key crashes the server. (Bug#25927: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25927" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25927</a>)<br /><br />- The values displayed for the Innodb_row_lock_time, Innodb_row_lock_time_avg, and Innodb_row_lock_time_max status variables were incorrect. (Bug#23666: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/23666" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/23666</a>)<br /><br />- COUNT(decimal_expr) sometimes generated a spurious truncation warning. (Bug#21976: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/21976" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/21976</a>)<br /><br />- With NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO SQL mode enabled, LOAD DATA operations could assign incorrect AUTO_INCREMENT values. (Bug#27586: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27586" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27586</a>)<br /><br />- Incorrect results could be returned for some queries that contained a select list expression with IN or BETWEEN together with an ORDER BY or GROUP BY on the same expression using NOT IN or NOT BETWEEN. (Bug#27532: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27532" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27532</a>)<br /><br />- Queries containing subqueries with COUNT(*) aggregated in an outer context returned incorrect results. This happened only if the subquery did not contain any references to outer columns. (Bug#27257: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27257" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27257</a>)<br /><br />- Use of an aggregate function from an outer context as an argument to GROUP_CONCAT() caused a server crash. (Bug#27229: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27229" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27229</a>)<br /><br />- REPAIR TABLE ... USE_FRM with an ARCHIVE table deleted all records from the table. (Bug#26138: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26138" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26138</a>)<br /><br />- On Windows, debug builds of mysqld could fail with heap assertions. (Bug#25765: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25765" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25765</a>)<br /><br />- On Windows, debug builds of mysqlbinlog could fail with a memory error. (Bug#23736: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/23736" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/23736</a>)<br /><br />- String truncation upon insertion into an integer or year column did not generate a warning (or an error in strict mode). (Bug#26359: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26359" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26359</a>, Bug#27176: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27176" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27176</a>)<br /><br />- In out-of-memory conditions, the server might crash or otherwise not report an error to the Windows event log. (Bug#27490: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27490" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27490</a>)<br /><br />- The temporary file-creation code was cleaned up on Windows to improve server stability. (Bug#26233: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26233" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26233</a>)<br /><br />- Out-of-memory errors for slave I/O threads were not reported. Now they are written to the error log. (Bug#26844: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26844" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26844</a>)<br /><br />- mysqldump crashed for MERGE tables if the --complete-insert (-c) option was given. (Bug#25993: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25993" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25993</a>)<br /><br />- In certain situations, MATCH ... AGAINST returned false hits for NULL values produced by LEFT JOIN when no full-text index was available. (Bug#25729: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25729" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25729</a>)<br /><br />- OPTIMIZE TABLE might fail on Windows when it attempts to rename a temporary file to the original name if the original file had been opened, resulting in loss of the .MYD file. (Bug#25521: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25521" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25521</a>)<br /><br />- GRANT statements were not replicated if the server was started with the --replicate-ignore-table or --replicate-wild-ignore-table option. (Bug#25482: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25482" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25482</a>)<br /><br />- A problem in handling of aggregate functions in subqueries caused predicates containing aggregate functions to be ignored during query execution. (Bug#24484: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/24484" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/24484</a>)<br /><br />- Improved out-of-memory detection when sending logs from a master server to slaves, and log a message when allocation fails. (Bug#26837: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26837" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26837</a>)<br /><br />- MBROverlaps() returned incorrect values in some cases. (Bug#24563: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/24563" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/24563</a>)<br /><br />- SHOW CREATE VIEW qualified references to stored functions in the view definition with the function's database name, even when the database was the default database. This affected mysqldump (which uses SHOW CREATE VIEW to dump views) because the resulting dump file could not be used to reload the database into a different database. SHOW CREATE VIEW now suppresses the database name for references to functions in the default database. (Bug#23491: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/23491" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/23491</a>)<br /><br />- With innodb_file_per_table enabled, attempting to rename an InnoDB table to a non-existent database caused the server to exit. (Bug#27381: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27381" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27381</a>)<br /><br />- mysql_install_db could terminate with an error after failing to determine that a system table already existed. (Bug#27022: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27022" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27022</a>)<br /><br />- For InnoDB tables having a clustered index that began with a CHAR or VARCHAR column, deleting a record and then inserting another before the deleted record was purged could result in table corruption. (Bug#26835: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26835" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26835</a>)<br /><br />- Selecting the result of AVG() within a UNION could produce incorrect values. (Bug#24791: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/24791" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/24791</a>)<br /><br />- An INTO OUTFILE clause is allowed only for the final SELECT of a UNION, but this restriction was not being enforced correctly.

MySQL was treating the "over-parenthesized" subquery as a single-row subquery and rejecting it if it returned more than one row. This bug primarily affected automatically generated code (such as queries generated by Hibernate), because humans rarely write the over-parenthesized forms.

The definitions of such views were stored using the IF() expression, not the original construct. This is manifest in that SHOW CREATE VIEW shows the transformed IF() expression, not the original one. Existing views will evaluate correctly after the fix, but if you want SHOW CREATE VIEW to display the original construct, you must drop the view and re-create it using its original definition.
