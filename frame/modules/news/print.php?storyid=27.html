        <h3>MySQL 5.0.2 リリース！</h3>
        <small><b>投稿日時</b>&nbsp;2004-12-2 20:43:01 | <b>トピック：</b>&nbsp;MySQL</small><br /><br /></td></tr><tr valign="top" style="font:12px;"><td>MySQL 5.0.2-alpha がリリースされました。<br />バージョン 5.0 系列では かなり久々のリリースです。<br /><br />久々だけあって、たくさんの修正や変更が行われています。<br />まだまだ alpha 版が続くと思いますが、実際に試された方はぜひ 本ニュースへのコメントや ML などに情報をお寄せください。<br /><br />Changes in release 5.0.2:<br /><br />■機能の追加と変更<br />- Warning: Incompatible change! The precedence of NOT operator has changed so that expressions such as NOT a BETWEEN b AND c are parsed correctly as NOT (a BETWEEN b AND c) rather than as (NOT a) BETWEEN b AND c. The pre-5.0 higher-precedence behavior can be obtained by enabling the new HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE SQL mode.<br /><br />- Added IS [NOT] boolean_value syntax, where boolean_value is TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN.<br /><br />- Added several InnoDB status variables. See section 5.2.4 Server Status Variables.<br /><br />- Implemented the WITH CHECK OPTION clause for CREATE VIEW.<br /><br />- The SCHEMA and SCHEMAS keywords are now accepted as synonyms for DATABASE and DATABASES.<br /><br />- Added initial support for rudimentary triggers (the CREATE TRIGGER and DROP TRIGGER statements).<br /><br />- Added basic support for read-only server side cursors.<br /><br />- mysqldump --single-transaction --master-data is now able to take an online (non-blocking) dump of InnoDB and report the corresponding binary log coordinates, which makes a backup suitable for point-in-time recovery, roll-forward or replication slave creation. See section 8.8 The mysqldump Database Backup Program.<br /><br />- Added --start-datetime, --stop-datetime, --start-position, --stop-position options to mysqlbinlog (makes point-in-time recovery easier).<br /><br />- Made the MySQL server not react to signals SIGHUP and SIGQUIT on Mac OS X 10.3. This is needed because under this OS, the MySQL server receives lots of these signals (reported as Bug #2030).<br /><br />- New --auto-increment-increment and --auto-increment-offset startup options. These allow you to set up a server to generate auto-increment values that don't conflict with another server.<br /><br />- MySQL now by default will check dates and only allow fully correct dates. If you want to MySQL to behave as default, you should enable the new ALLOW_INVALID_DATES SQL mode.<br /><br />- Added STRICT_TRANS_TABLES, STRICT_ALL_TABLES, NO_ZERO_IN_DATE, NO_ZERO_DATE, ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO, and TRADITIONAL SQL modes. The TRADITIONAL mode is shorthand for all the preceding modes. When using mode TRADITIONAL, MySQL generates an error if you try to insert a wrong value in a column. It does not adjust the value to the closest possible legal value.<br /><br />- MySQL now remembers which columns were declared to have default values. In STRICT_TRANS_TABLES/STRICT_ALL_TABLES mode, you now get an error if you do an INSERT without specifying all columns that don't have a default value. A side effect of this is that when you do SHOW CREATE for a new table, you will no longer see a DEFAULT value for a column for which you didn't specify a default value.<br />- The compilation flag DONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS was removed because you can get the same behavior by setting the sql_mode system variable to STRICT_TRANS_TABLES.<br /><br />- Added NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER SQL mode to prevent GRANT from automatically creating new users if it would otherwise do so, unless a password also is specified.<br /><br />- We now detect too-large floating point numbers during statement parsing and generate an error messages for them.<br /><br />- Renamed the sql_updatable_view_key system variable to updatable_views_with_limit. This variable now can have only two values:<br />     + 1 or YES: Don't issue an error message (warning only) if a<br />       VIEW without presence of a key in the underlying table is<br />       used in queries with a LIMIT clause for updating. (This is<br />       the default value.)<br />     + 0 or NO: Prohibit update of a VIEW, which does not contain a<br />       key in the underlying table and the query uses a LIMIT clause<br />       (usually found in GUI tools).<br />- Reverted output format of SHOW TABLES to old pre-5.0.1 format that did not include a table type column. To get the additional column that lists the table type, use SHOW FULL TABLES now.<br /><br />- The mysql_fix_privilege_tables script now initializes the global CREATE VIEW and SHOW VIEW privileges in the user table to the value of the CREATE privilege in that table.<br /><br />- If the server finds that the user table has not been upgraded to include the view-related privilege columns, it treats each account as having view privileges that are the same as its CREATE privilege.<br /><br />- CHECK TABLE now works with VIEWs (i.e. check view integrity: all underlying tables and columns are present and so on)<br /><br />- Added merge algorithm for join VIEW (view consists of several tables) and UPDATE/INSERT support for one of underlying tables in such VIEWs.<br /><br />■バグ修正:<br />- Fixed that mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server sometimes couldn't accept two binary logfiles on the command line. (Bug #4507)<br /><br />- Fixed that mysqlbinlog --position --read-from-remote-server had incorrect # at lines. (Bug #4506)<br /><br />- Fixed that CREATE TABLE ... TYPE=HEAP ... AS SELECT... caused replication slave to stop. (Bug #4971)<br /><br />- Fixed that mysql_options(...,MYSQL_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE,...) failed to disable LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE. (Bug #5038)<br /><br />- Fixed that disable-local-infile option had no effect if client read it from a configuration file using mysql_options(...,MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT,...). (Bug #5073)<br /><br />- Fixed that SET GLOBAL SYNC_BINLOG did not work on some platforms (Mac OS X). (Bug #5064)<br /><br />- Fixed that mysql-test-run failed on the rpl_trunc_binlog test if running test from the installed (the target of 'make install') directory. (Bug #5050)<br /><br />- Fixed that mysql-test-run failed on the grant_cache test when run as Unix user 'root'. (Bug #4678)<br /><br />- Fixed an unlikely deadlock which could happen when using KILL. (Bug #4810)<br /><br />- Fixed a crash when one connection got KILLed while it was doing START SLAVE. (Bug #4827)<br /><br />- Made FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK block COMMIT if server is running with binary logging; this ensures that the binary log position can be trusted when doing a full backup of tables and the binary log. (Bug #4953)<br /><br />- Fixed that the counter of an auto_increment column was not reset by TRUNCATE TABLE is the table was a temporary one. (Bug #5033)<br /><br />- Fixed slave SQL thread so that the SET COLLATION_SERVER... statements it replicates don't advance its position (so that if it gets interrupted before the actual update query, it will later redo the SET). (Bug #5705)<br /><br />- Fixed that if the slave SQL thread found a syntax error in a query (which should be rare, as the master parsed it successfully), it stops. (Bug #5711)<br /><br />- Fixed that if a write to a MyISAM table fails because of a full disk or an exceeded disk quota, it prints a message to the error log every 10 minutes, and waits until disk becomes free. (Bug #3248)<br /><br />- Fixed problem introduced in 4.0.21 where a connection starting a transaction, doing updates, then FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK, then COMMIT, would cause replication slaves to stop (complaining about error 1223). Bug surfaced when using the InnoDB innobackup script. (Bug #5949)<br /><br />- OPTIMIZE TABLE, REPAIR TABLE, and ANALYZE TABLE are now replicated without any error code in the binary log. (Bug #5551)<br /><br /><br /></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
