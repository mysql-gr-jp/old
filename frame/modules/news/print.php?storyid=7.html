        <h3>MySQL 4.0.15 リリース</h3>
        <small><b>投稿日時</b>&nbsp;2003-9-11 15:20:00 | <b>トピック：</b>&nbsp;MySQL</small><br /><br /></td></tr><tr valign="top" style="font:12px;"><td>MySQL 4.0.15 がリリースされました。<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com/</a>  　からダウンロードできます。<br /><br /><br />News from the ChangeLog:<br /><br />Functionality added or changed:<br /><br /> * `mysqldump' now correctly quotes all identifiers when communicating<br />   with the server. This assures that during the dump process,<br />   `mysqldump' will never send queries to the server that result in a<br />   syntax error.  This problem is *not* related to the `mysqldump'<br />   program's output, which was not changed. (Bug #1148)<br /><br /> * Change result set metadata information so that `MIN()' and `MAX()'<br />   report that they can return `NULL' (this is true because an empty<br />   set will return `NULL'). (Bug #324)<br /><br /> * Produce an error message on Windows if a second `mysqld' server is<br />   started on the same TCP/IP port as an already running `mysqld'<br />   server.<br /><br /> * The `mysqld' server variables `wait_timeout', `net_read_timeout'<br />   and `net_write_timeout' now work on Windows.<br /><br /> * Added option `--sql-mode=NO_DIR_IN_CREATE' to make it possible for<br />   slaves to ignore `INDEX DIRECTORY' and `DATA DIRECTORY' options<br />   given to `CREATE TABLE'.  When this is mode is on, `SHOW CREATE<br />   TABLE' will not show the given directories.<br /><br /> * `SHOW CREATE TABLE' now shows the `INDEX DIRECTORY' and `DATA<br />   DIRECTORY' options, if they were specified when the table was<br />   created.<br /><br /> * The `open_files_limit' server variable now shows the real open<br />   files limit.<br /><br /> * `MATCH ... AGAINST()' in natural language mode now treats words<br />   that are present in more than 2,000,000 rows as stopwords.<br /><br /> * The Mac OS X installation disk images now include an additional<br />   `MySQLStartupItem.pkg' package that enables the automatic startup<br />   of MySQL on system bootup.  *Note Mac OS X installation::.<br /><br /> * Most of the documentation included in the binary tarball<br />   distributions (`.tar.gz') has been moved into a subdirectory<br />   `docs'.  *Note Installation layouts::.<br /><br /> * The manual is now included as an additional `info' file in the<br />   binary distributions. (Bug #1019)<br /><br /> * Many binary distributions now include the embedded server library<br />   (`libmysqld') by default.  *Note Nutshell Embedded MySQL::.<br /><br /> * MySQL can now use range optimisation for `BETWEEN' with<br />   non-constant limits. (Bug #991)<br /><br /> * Replication error messages now include the default database, so<br />   that users can check which database the failing query was run for.<br /><br /> * Now the slave does not replicate `SET PASSWORD' if it is<br />   configured to exclude the `mysql' database from replication (using<br />   for example `replicate-wild-ignore-table=mysql.%'). This was<br />   already the case for `GRANT' and `REVOKE' since version 4.0.13<br />   (though there was Bug #980 in 4.0.13 & 4.0.14, which has been<br />   fixed in 4.0.15).<br /><br /> * Rewrote the information shown in the `State' column of `SHOW<br />   PROCESSLIST' for replication threads and for `MASTER_POS_WAIT()'<br />   and added the most common states for these threads to the<br />   documentation, *note Replication Implementation Details::.<br /><br /> * Added a test in replication to detect the case where the master<br />   died in the middle of writing a transaction to the binlog; such<br />   unfinished transactions now trigger an error message on the slave.<br /><br /> * A `GRANT' command that creates an anonymous user (that is, an<br />   account with an empty username) no longer requires `FLUSH<br />   PRIVILEGES' for the account to be recognized by the server.  (Bug<br />   #473)<br /><br /> * `CHANGE MASTER' now flushes `relay-log.info'. Previously this was<br />   deferred to the next run of `START SLAVE', so if `mysqld' was<br />   shutdown on the slave after `CHANGE MASTER' without having run<br />   `START SLAVE', the relay log's name and position were lost. At<br />   restart they were reloaded from `relay-log.info', thus reverting<br />   to their old (incorrect) values from before `CHANGE MASTER' and<br />   leading to error messages (as the old relay log did not exist any<br />   more) and the slave threads refusing to start. (Bug #858)<br /><br />Bugs fixed:<br /><br /> * Fixed buffer overflow in SET PASSWORD which could potentially be<br />   exploited by MySQL users with root privileges to execute random code or<br />   to gain shell access (thanks to Jedi/Sector One for spotting and<br />   reporting this one).<br /><br /> * Fixed server crash on `FORCE INDEX' in a query that contained<br />   "Range checked for each record" in the `EXPLAIN' output.<br />   (Bug #1172)<br /><br /> * Fixed table/column grant handling - proper sort order (from most<br />   specific to less specific, *note Request access::) was not honored.<br />   (Bug #928)<br /><br /> * Fixed rare bug in MYISAM introduced in 4.0.3 where the index file<br />   header was not updated directly after an `UPDATE' of split dynamic<br />   rows.  The symptom was that the table had a corrupted delete-link<br />   if mysqld was shut down or the table was checked directly after<br />   the update.<br /><br /> * Fixed `Can't unlock file' error when running `myisamchk<br />   --sort-index' on Windows. (Bug #1119)<br /><br /> * Fixed possible deadlock when changing `key_buffer_size' while the<br />   key cache was actively used. (Bug #1088)<br /><br /> * Fixed overflow bug in `MyISAM' and `ISAM' when a row is updated in<br />   a table with a large number of columns and at least one `BLOB/TEXT'<br />   column.<br /><br /> * Fixed incorrect result when doing `UNION' and `LIMIT #,#' when one<br />   didn't use braces around the `SELECT' parts.<br /><br /> * Fixed incorrect result when doing `UNION' and `ORDER BY .. LIMIT #'<br />   when one didn't use braces around the `SELECT' parts.<br /><br /> * Fixed problem with `SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS ... UNION ALL ...<br />   LIMIT #' where `FOUND_ROWS()' returned incorrect number of rows.<br /><br /> * Fixed unlikely stack bug when having a BIG expression of type<br />   `1+1-1+1-1...' in certain combinations. (Bug #871)<br /><br /> * Fixed the bug that sometimes prevented a table with a `FULLTEXT'<br />   index from being marked as "analyzed".<br /><br /> * Fixed MySQL so that the field length (in C API) for the second<br />   column in `SHOW CREATE TABLE' is always larger than the data<br />   length.  The only known application that was affected by the old<br />   behaviour was Borland dbExpress, which truncated the output from<br />   the command.  (Bug #1064)<br /><br /> * Fixed crash in comparisons of strings using the `tis620' character<br />   set. (Bug #1116)<br /><br /> * Fixed `ISAM' bug in `MAX()' optimisation.<br /><br /> * `myisamchk --sort-records=N' no longer marks table as crashed if<br />   sorting failed because of an inappropriate key. (Bug #892)<br /><br /> * Fixed a minor bug in `MyISAM' compressed table handling that<br />   sometimes made it impossible to repair compressed table in "Repair<br />   by sort" mode.  "Repair with keycache" (`myisamchk<br />   --safe-recover') worked, though.  (Bug #1015)<br /><br /> * Fixed bug in propagating the version number to the manual included<br />   in the distribution files. (Bug #1020)<br /><br /> * Fixed key sorting problem (a `PRIMARY' key declared for a column<br />   that is not explicitly marked `NOT NULL' was sorted after a<br />   `UNIQUE' key for a `NOT NULL' column).<br /><br /> * Fixed the result of `INTERVAL' when applied to a `DATE' value.<br />   (Bug #792)<br /><br /> * Fixed compiling of the embedded server library in the RPM spec<br />   file.  (Bug #959)<br /><br /> * Added some missing files to the RPM spec file and fixed some RPM<br />   building errors that occured on Red Hat Linux 9. (Bug #998)<br /><br /> * Fixed incorrect `XOR' evaluation in `WHERE' clause. (Bug #992)<br /><br /> * Fixed bug with processing in query cache merged tables constructed<br />   from more then 255 tables. (Bug #930)<br /><br /> * Fixed incorrect results from outer join query (e.g. `LEFT JOIN')<br />   when `ON' condition is always false, and range search in used.<br />   (Bug #926)<br /><br /> * Fixed a bug causing incorrect results from `MATCH ... AGAINST()'<br />   in some joins. (Bug #942)<br /><br /> * `MERGE' tables do not ignore "Using index" (from `EXPLAIN' output)<br />   anymore.<br /><br /> * Fixed a bug that prevented an empty table from being marked as<br />   "analyzed".  (Bug #937)<br /><br /> * Fixed `myisamchk --sort-records' crash when used on compressed<br />   table.<br /><br /> * Fixed slow (as compared to 3.23) `ALTER TABLE' and related<br />   commands such as `CREATE INDEX'.  (Bug #712)<br /><br /> * Fixed segmentation fault resulting from `LOAD DATA FROM MASTER'<br />   when the master was running without the `--log-bin' option. (Bug<br />   #934)<br /><br /> * Fixed a security bug: A server compiled without SSL support still<br />   allowed connections by users that had the `REQUIRE SSL' option<br />   specified for their accounts.<br /><br /> * Fixed a random bug: Sometimes the slave would replicate `GRANT' or<br />   `REVOKE' queries even if it was configured to exclude the `mysql'<br />   database from replication (for example, using<br />   `replicate-wild-ignore-table=mysql.%'). (Bug #980)<br /><br /> * The `Last_errno' and `Last_error' fields in the output of `SHOW<br />   SLAVE STATUS' are now cleared by `CHANGE MASTER' and when the<br />   slave SQL thread starts. (Bug #986)<br /><br /> * A documentation mistake: It said that `RESET SLAVE' does not change<br />   connection information  (master host, port, user, and password),<br />   whereas it does. The statement resets these to the startup options<br />   (`master-host' etc) if there were some. (Bug #985)<br /><br /> * `SHOW SLAVE STATUS' now shows correct information (master host,<br />   port, user, and password) after `RESET SLAVE' (that is, it shows<br />   the new values, which are copied from the startup options if there<br />   were some). (Bug #985)<br /><br /> * Disabled propagation of the original master's log position for<br />   events because this caused unexpected values for<br />   `Exec_master_log_pos' and problems with `MASTER_POS_WAIT()' in<br />   A->B->C replication setup. (Bug #1086)<br /><br /> * Fixed a segfault in `mysqlbinlog' when `--position=x' was used<br />   with `x' being between a `Create_file' event and its fellow<br />   `Append_block', `Exec_load' or `Delete_file' events. (Bug #1091)<br /><br /> * `mysqlbinlog' printed superfluous warnings when using<br />   `--database', which caused syntax errors when piped to `mysql'.<br />   (Bug #1092)<br /><br /> * Made `mysqlbinlog --database' filter `LOAD DATA INFILE' too<br />   (previously, it filtered all queries except `LOAD DATA INFILE').<br />   (Bug #1093)<br /><br /> * `mysqlbinlog' in some cases forgot to put a leading `'#'' in front<br />   of the original `LOAD DATA INFILE' (this command is displayed only<br />   for information, not to be run; it is later reworked to `LOAD DATA<br />   LOCAL' with a different filename, for execution by `mysql'). (Bug<br />   #1096)<br /><br /> * `binlog-do-db' and `binlog-ignore-db' incorrectly filtered `LOAD<br />   DATA INFILE' (it was half-written to the binary log). This<br />   resulted in a corrupted binary log, which could cause the slave to<br />   stop with an error. (Bug #1100)<br /><br /> * When, in a transaction, a transactional table (such as an `InnoDB'<br />   table) was updated, and later in the same transaction a<br />   non-transactional table (such as a `MyISAM' table) was updated<br />   using the updated content of the transactional table (with `INSERT<br />   ... SELECT' for example), the queries were written to the binary<br />   log in an incorrect order. (Bug #873)<br /><br /> * When, in a transaction, `INSERT ... SELECT' updated a<br />   non-transactional table, and `ROLLBACK' was issued, no error was<br />   returned to the client. Now the client is warned that some changes<br />   could not be rolled back, as this was already the case for normal<br />   `INSERT'. (Bug #1113)<br /><br /> * Fixed a potential bug: When `STOP SLAVE' was run while the slave<br />   SQL thread was in the middle of a transaction, and then `CHANGE<br />   MASTER' was used to point the slave to some non-transactional<br />   statement, the SQL slave thread could get confused (because it<br />   would still think, from the past, that it was in a transaction).<br /><br />Additional notes:<br /><br />MySQL 4.0.15 is now available on the following additional platforms:<br /><br /> * HP-UX 11i for Itanium<br /> * OpenBSD 3.4 x86<br /><br />The binaries for Linux/s390 are currently missing - they will be made<br />available as soon as possible.<br /><br /><br /></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
