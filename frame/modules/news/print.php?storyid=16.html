        <h3>MySQL 4.1.4 リリース</h3>
        <small><b>投稿日時</b>&nbsp;2004-9-1 23:44:00 | <b>トピック：</b>&nbsp;MySQL</small><br /><br /></td></tr><tr valign="top" style="font:12px;"><td>MySQL 4.1.4 がリリースされました<br /><br />ガンマ版になってますねッ<br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />MySQL 4.1.4, a new version of the popular Open Source/Free Software<br />Database Management System, has been released. It is now available in<br />source and binary form for a number of platforms from our download pages<br />at <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/"><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/" target="_blank">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/</a></a> and<br />mirror sites.<br /><br />Note that not all mirror sites may be up to date at this point in time -<br />if you can't find this version on some mirror, please try again later or<br />choose another download site.<br /><br />This is a new gamma development release, adding new features and fixing<br />recently discovered bugs.<br /><br />Please refer to our bug database at <a<br />href="http://bugs.mysql.com/"><a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a></a> for more<br />details about the individual bugs fixed in this version.<br /><br />News from the ChangeLog:<br /><br />Functionality added or changed:<br /><br />     * Made internal representation of TIMESTAMP values in InnoDB in 4.1<br />       to be the same as in 4.0. This difference resulted in wrong<br />       datetime values in TIMESTAMP columns in InnoDB tables after<br />       upgrade from 4.0 to 4.1. (Bug #4492) Warning: extra steps during<br />       upgrade required! Unfortunately this means that if you are<br />       upgrading from 4.1.x, where x <= 3, to 4.1.4 you should use<br />       mysqldump for saving and then restoring your InnoDB tables with<br />       TIMESTAMP columns.<br />     * The mysqld-opt Windows server was renamed to mysqld. This<br />       completes the Windows server renaming begun in MySQL 4.1.2. See<br />       section "Selecting a Windows Server" in the manual.<br />     * Added Latin language collations for the ucs2 and utf8 Unicode<br />       character sets. These are called ucs2_roman_ci and utf8_roman_ci.<br />     * Corrected the name of the Mac OS X StartupItem script (it must<br />       match the name of the subdirectory, which was renamed to MySQLCOM<br />       in MySQL 4.1.2). Thanks to Bryan McCormack for reporting this.<br />     * Added --start-datetime, --stop-datetime, --start-position, and<br />       --stop-position options to mysqlbinlog. These make point-in-time<br />       recovery easier.<br />     * Killing CHECK TABLE no longer results in the table being marked as<br />       "corrupted"; the table status remains the same as it was before<br />       CHECK TABLE started. See section "KILL Syntax" in the manual.<br />     * Made the MySQL server ignore SIGHUP and SIGQUIT on Mac OS X 10.3.<br />       This is needed because under this OS, the MySQL server receives<br />       lots of these signals (reported as Bug #2030).<br /><br />   Bugs fixed:<br /><br />     * Fixed a bug that caused libmysql to crash when attempting to fetch<br />       a value of MEDIUMINT column. (Bug #5126)<br />     * Fixed a bug that caused the MySQL server to crash when attempting<br />       to execute a prepared statement with SELECT ... INTO @var for a<br />       second time. (Bug #5034)<br />     * Fixed execution of optimized IN subqueries that use compound<br />       indexes. (Bug #4435)<br />     * Prohibited resolving of table fields in inner queries if fields do<br />       not take part in grouping for queries with grouping (inside<br />       aggregate function arguments, all table fields are still allowed).<br />       (Bug #4814)<br />     * Fixed a crash after SLAVE STOP if the IO thread was in a special<br />       state. (Bug #4629)<br />     * Fixed an old bug in concurrent accesses to MERGE tables (even one<br />       MERGE table and MyISAM tables), that could have resulted in a<br />       crash or hang of the server. (Bug #2408)<br />     * Fixed a bug that caused server crash on attempt to execute for a<br />       second time a prepared statement with NOT in WHERE or ON clauses.<br />       (Bug #4912)<br />     * MATCH ... AGAINST now works in a subquery. (Bug #4769)<br />     * Fixed a bug that omitted the `.err' extension of the error log<br />       file (--log-error) when the hostname contained a domain name. The<br />       domain name is now replaced by the extension. (BUG #4997)<br />     * Fixed a crash in myisamchk. (Bug #4901)<br />     * Fixed a bug which caused server crash if one used the CONVERT_TZ()<br />       function with time zone described in database as parameter and<br />       this time zone was not used before. (Bug #4508)<br />     * Support for %T, %r, %V, %v and %X, %x format specifiers was added<br />       to STR_TO_DATE() function. (Bug #4756)<br />     * Fixed a bug (hang) in NATURAL JOIN where joined table had no<br />       common column. (Bug #4807)<br />     * Fixed a crash caused by UNHEX(NULL). (Bug #4441)<br />     * mysql_fix_privilege_tables didn't correctly handle the argument of<br />       its --password=# option. (Bug #4240, Bug #4543)<br />     * Fixed that mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server sometimes<br />       couldn't accept 2 binary logs on command line. (Bug #4507)<br />     * Fixed that mysqlbinlog --position --read-from-remote-server had<br />       wrong # at lines. (Bug #4506)<br />     * If CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE t SELECT failed while loading the data,<br />       the temporary table was not dropped. (Bug #4551)<br />     * Fixed that when a multiple-table DROP TABLE failed to drop a table<br />       on master, the error code was not written to the binary log. (Bug<br />       #4553)<br />     * When the slave SQL thread was replicating a LOAD DATA INFILE it<br />       didn't show it in the output of SHOW PROCESSLIST. (Bug #4326)<br />     * Fixed an assertion failure when reading the grant tables (Bug<br />       #4407)<br />     * Fixed that CREATE TABLE ... TYPE=HEAP ... AS SELECT... caused<br />       replication slave to stop. (Bug #4971)<br />     * Fixed that mysql_options(...,MYSQL_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE,...) failed to<br />       disable LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE. (Bug #5038)<br />     * Fixed that disable-local-infile option had no effect if client<br />       read it from a configuration file using<br />       mysql_options(...,MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT,...). (Bug #5073)<br />     * Fixed that SET GLOBAL SYNC_BINLOG did not work on some platforms<br />       (Mac OS X). (Bug #5064)<br />     * Fixed that mysql-test-run failed on the rpl_trunc_binlog test if<br />       running test from the installed (the target of 'make install')<br />       directory. (Bug #5050)<br />     * Fixed that mysql-test-run failed on the grant_cache test when run<br />       as Unix user 'root'. (Bug #4678)<br />     * Fixed an unlikely deadlock which could happen when using KILL.<br />       (Bug #4810)<br />     * Fixed a crash when one connection got KILLed while it was doing<br />       START SLAVE. (Bug #4827)<br />     * Made FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK block COMMIT if server is running<br />       with binary logging; this ensures that the binary log position is<br />       trustable when doing a full backup of tables and the binary log.<br />       (Bug #4953)<br />     * Fixed that the counter of an auto_increment column was not reset<br />       by TRUNCATE TABLE if the table was a temporary table.
