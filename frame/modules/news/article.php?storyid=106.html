    <p class="itemText">MySQL 6.0.4-alpha がリリースされました。<br /><br />新しいトランザクショナルストレージエンジンである falcon の開発がこのメジャーバージョンで進行されている点で、注目の新バージョンです。　200項目以上にわたる修正がなされています。<br />4バイト utf8 (rfc3629) にもこのバージョンで対応したようですね。<br /><br /><br />○MySQL 6.0 についてはこちら:<br /><a href="http://www.mysql.com/mysql60/" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com/mysql60/</a><br /><br />○ダウンロードはこちら：<br /><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/6.0.html" target="_blank">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/6.0.html</a><br /><br />-------<br />以下チェンジログ<br /><br />■機能の追加と変更(6.0.4)：<br />- Important Change: Partitioning: Security Fix: It was possible, by creating a partitioned table using the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to gain privileges on other tables having the same name as the partitioned table. As a result of this fix, any table-level DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY options are now ignored for partitioned tables. (Bug#32091: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/32091" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/32091</a>, CVE-2007-5970 (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5970" target="_blank">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5970</a>)) See also Bug#29325: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29325" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/29325</a>, Bug#32111: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/32111" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/32111</a><br /><br />- Incompatible Change: The Unicode implementation has been extended to provide support for supplementary characters that lie outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). Noteworthy features: <br />　　+ utf16 and utf32 character sets have been added. These correspond to the UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings of the Unicode character set, and they both support supplementary characters. <br />　　+ The utf8 character set from previous versions of MySQL has been renamed to utf8mb3, to reflect that its encoding uses a maximum of three bytes for multi-byte characters. (Old tables that previously used utf8 will be reported as using utf8mb3 after an in-place upgrade to MySQL 6.0, but otherwise work as before.) <br />　　+ The new utf8 character set in MySQL 6.0 is similar to utf8mb3, but its encoding allows up to four bytes per character to enable support for supplementary characters. <br />　　+ The ucs2 character set is essentially unchanged except for the inclusion of some newer BMP characters. In most respects, upgrading from MySQL 5.1 to 6.0 should present few problems with regard to Unicode usage, although there are some potential areas of incompatibility. Some examples: <br />　　+ For the variable-length character data types (VARCHAR and the TEXT types), the maximum length in characters for utf8 columns is less in MySQL 6.0 than previously. <br />　　+ For all character data types (CHAR, VARCHAR, and the TEXT types), the maximum number of characters for utf8 columns that can be indexed is less in MySQL 6.0 than previously. Consequently, if you want to upgrade tables from the old utf8 (now utf8mb3) to the current utf8, it may be necessary to change some column or index definitions. For additional details about the new Unicode character sets and potential incompatibilities, see Section 9.1.8, "Unicode Support," and Section 9.1.9, "Upgrading from Previous to Current Unicode Support." If you use events, a known issue is that if you upgrade from MySQL 5.1 to 6.0.4, the event scheduler will not work, even after you run mysql_upgrade. (This is an issue only for an upgrade, not for a new installation of MySQL 6.0.4.) To work around this upgrading problem, use these instructions: <br />　　　1. In MySQL 5.1, before upgrading, create a dump file containing your mysql.event table:<br />　　　　shell> mysqldump -uroot -p mysql event > event.sql <br />　　　2. Stop the server, upgrade to MySQL 6.0, and start the server. <br />　　　3. Recreate the mysql.event table using the dump file:<br />　　　　shell> mysql -uroot -p mysql < event.sql <br />　　　4. Run mysql_upgrade to upgrade the other system tables in the mysql database:<br />　　　　shell> mysql_upgrade -uroot -p <br />　　　5. Restart the server. The event scheduler should run normally.<br /><br />- Incompatible Change: Because of a change in the format of the Falcon pages stored within Falcon database files, Falcon databases created in MySQL 6.0.4 (or later) are not compatible with previous releases, and existing Falcon databases are incompatible with MySQL 6.0.4 (and later versions. You should dump Falcon databases using mysqldump before upgrading, and then reload them after the upgrade. For more information, see Section 4.5.4, "mysqldump --- A Database Backup Program."<br /><br />- Partitioning: Error messages for partitioning syntax errors have been made more descriptive. (Bug#29368: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29368" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/29368</a>)<br /><br />- Replication: Replication of the following now switches to row-based logging in MIXED mode, and generates a warning in STATEMENT mode: <br />　　+ USER() <br />　　+ CURRENT_USER() <br />　　+ CURRENT_USER <br />　　+ FOUND_ROWS() <br />　　+ ROW_COUNT() See Section 5.2.4.3, "Mixed Binary Logging (MBL) Format," for more information. (Bug#12092: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/12092" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/12092</a>, Bug#28086: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/28086" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/28086</a>, Bug#30244: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30244" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/30244</a>)<br /><br />- Cluster Replication: A replication heartbeat mechanism has been added to facilitate monitoring. This provides an alternative to checking log files, making it possible to detect in real time when a slave has failed. Configuration of heartbeats is done via a new MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD = interval clause for the CHANGE MASTER TO statement (see Section 12.6.2.1, "CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"); monitoring can be done by checking the values of the status variables Slave_heartbeat_period and Slave_received_heartbeats (see Section 5.1.5, "Status Variables"). The addition of replication heartbeats addresses a number of issues: <br />　　+ Relay logs were rotated every slave_net_timeout seconds even if no statements were being replicated. <br />　　+ SHOW SLAVE STATUS displayed an incorrect value for seconds_behind_master following a FLUSH LOGS statement. <br />　　+ Replication master-slave connections used slave_net_timeout for connection timeouts. (Bug#20435: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/20435" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/20435</a>, Bug#29309: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29309" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/29309</a>, Bug#30932: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30932" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/30932</a>)<br /><br />- The --event-scheduler option without a value disabled the event scheduler. Now it enables the event scheduler. (Bug#31332: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/31332" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/31332</a>)<br /><br />- mysqldump produces a -- Dump completed on DATE comment at the end of the dump if --comments is given. The date causes dump files for identical data taken at different times to appear to be different. The new options --dump-date and --skip-dump-date control whether the date is added to the comment. --skip-dump-date suppresses date printing. The default is --dump-date (include the date in the comment). (Bug#31077: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/31077" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/31077</a>)<br /><br />- MySQL now can be compiled with gcc 4.2.x. There was a problem involving a conflict with the min() and max() macros in my_global.h. (Bug#28184: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/28184" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/28184</a>)<br /><br />- It is now possible to set long_query_time in microseconds or to 0. Setting this value to 0 causes all queries to be recorded in the slow query log. Currently, fractional values can be used only when logging to files. We plan to provide this functionality for logging to tables when time-related data types are enhanced to support microsecond resolution. (Bug#25412: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25412" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25412</a>)<br /><br />- INFORMATION_SCHEMA implementation changes were made that optimize certain types of queries for INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables so that they execute more quickly. Section 7.2.17, "INFORMATION_SCHEMA Optimization," provides guidelines on how to take advantage of these optimizations by writing queries that minimize the need for the server to access the filesystem to obtain the information contained in INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables. By writing queries that enable the server to avoid directory scans or opening table files, you will obtain better performance. (Bug#19588: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/19588" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/19588</a>)<br /><br />- Three options were added to mysqldump make it easier to generate a dump from a slave server. --dump-slave is similar to --master-data, but the CHANGE MASTER statement contains binary log coordinates for the slave's master host, not the slave itself. --apply-slave-statements causes STOP SLAVE and START SLAVE statements to be added before the CHANGE MASTER statement and at the end of the output, respectively. --include-master-host-port causes the CHANGE MASTER statement to include MASTER_PORT and MASTER_HOST options for the slave's master. (Bug#8368: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/8368" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/8368</a>)<br /><br />- An alternative thread model is available for dealing with the issues that occur with the original one-thread-per-client model when scaling to large numbers of simultaneous connections. This model uses thread pooling: <br />　　+ Connection manager threads do not dedicate a thread to each client connection. Instead, the connection is added to the set of existing connection sockets. The server collects input from these sockets and when a complete request has been received from a given client, it is queued for service. <br />　　+ The server maintains a pool of service threads to process requests. When a queued request is waiting and there is an available (not busy) service thread in the pool, the request is given to the thread to be handled. After processing the request, the service thread becomes available to process other requests. Service threads are created at server startup and exist until the server terminates. A given service thread is not tied to a specific client connection and the requests that it processes over time may originate from different client connections. <br />　　+ The pool of service threads has a fixed size, so the amount of memory required for it does not increase as the number of client connections increases. For information about choosing one thread model over the other and tuning the parameters that control thread resources, see Section 7.5.7, "How MySQL Uses Threads for Client Connections."<br /><br />- When the server detects MyISAM table corruption, it now writes additional information to the error log, such as the name and line number of the source file, and the list of threads accessing the table. Example: Got an error from thread_id=1, mi_dynrec.c:368. This is useful information to include in bug reports.<br /><br />- Two options relating to slow query logging have been added for mysqld. --log-slow-slave-statements causes slow statements executed by a replication slave to be written to the slow query log; in_examined_row_limit can be used to cause queries which examine fewer than the stated number of rows not to be logged.<br /><br /><br /><br />■バグ修正(6.0.4)：<br /><br />- Security Fix: Replication: It was possible for any connected user to issue a BINLOG statement, which could be used to escalate privileges. Use of the BINLOG statement now requires the SUPER privilege. (Bug#31611: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/31611" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/31611</a>, CVE-2007-6313 (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6313" target="_blank">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6313</a>))<br /><br />- Security Fix: Three vulnerabilities in yaSSL versions 1.7.5 and earlier were discovered that could lead to a server crash or execution of unauthorized code. The exploit requires a server with yaSSL enabled and TCP/IP connections enabled, but does not require valid MySQL account credentials. The exploit does not apply to OpenSSL. お知らせ: The proof-of-concept exploit is freely available on the Internet- Everyone with a vulnerable MySQL configuration is advised to upgrade immediately. (Bug#33814: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/33814" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/33814</a>, CVE-2008-0226 (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0226" target="_blank">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0226</a>), CVE-2008-0227 (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0227" target="_blank">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0227</a>))<br /><br />- Security Fix: Using RENAME TABLE against a table with explicit DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options can be used to overwrite system table information by replacing the symbolic link points. the file to which the symlink points. MySQL will now return an error when the file to which the symlink points already exists. (Bug#32111: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/32111" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/32111</a>, CVE-2007-5969 (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5969" target="_blank">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5969</a>))<br /><br />- Security Fix: ALTER VIEW retained the original DEFINER value, even when altered by another user, which could allow that user to gain the access rights of the view. Now ALTER VIEW is allowed only to the original definer or users with the SUPER privilege. (Bug#29908: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29908" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/29908</a>)<br /><br />- Security Fix: When using a FEDERATED table, the local server could be forced to crash if the remote server returned a result with fewer columns than expected. (Bug#29801: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/29801" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/29801</a>)<br /><br />- Important Change: Incompatible Change: A number of problems existed in the implementation of MERGE tables that could cause problems. The problems are summarized below: <br />　　+ Bug#26379: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26379" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26379</a> - Combination of FLUSH TABLE and REPAIR TABLE corrupts a MERGE table. This was caused in a number of situations: 1. A thread trying to lock a MERGE table performs busy waiting while REPAIR TABLE or a similar table administration task is ongoing on one or more of its MyISAM tables. 2. A thread trying to lock a MERGE table performs busy waiting until all threads that did REPAIR TABLE or similar table administration tasks on one or more of its MyISAM tables in LOCK TABLES segments do UNLOCK TABLES. The difference against problem #1 is that the busy waiting takes place after the administration task. It is terminated by UNLOCK TABLES only. 3. Two FLUSH TABLES within a LOCK TABLES segment can invalidate the lock. This does not require a MERGE table. The first FLUSH TABLES can be replaced by any statement that requires other threads to reopen the table. In 5.0 and 5.1 a single FLUSH TABLES can provoke the problem. <br />　　+ Bug#26867: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26867" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26867</a> - Simultaneously executing LOCK TABLES and REPAIR TABLE on a MERGE table would result in memory/cpu hogging. Trying DML on a MERGE table, which has a child locked and repaired by another thread, made an infinite loop in the server. <br />　　+ Bug#26377: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26377" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26377</a> - Deadlock with MERGE and FLUSH TABLE Locking a MERGE table and its children in parent-child order and flushing the child deadlocked the server. <br />　　+ Bug#25038: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25038" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25038</a> - Waiting TRUNCATE Truncating a MERGE child, while the MERGE table was in use, let the truncate fail instead of waiting for the table to become free. <br />　　+ Bug#25700: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/25700" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/25700</a> - MERGE base tables get corrupted by OPTIMIZE/ANALYZE/REPAIR TABLE Repairing a child of an open MERGE table corrupted the child.

Flushing and optimizing locked MERGE children crashed the server. <br />　　+ Bug#19627: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/19627" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/19627</a> - temporary merge table locking Use of a temporary MERGE table with non-temporary children could corrupt the children. Temporary tables are never locked. Creation of tables with non-temporary children of a temporary MERGE table is now prohibited. <br />　　+ Bug#27660: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/27660" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/27660</a> - Falcon: MERGE table possible It was possible to create a MERGE table with non-MyISAM children. <br />　　+ Bug#30273: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30273" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/30273</a> - MERGE tables: Can't lock file (errno: 155) This was a Windows-only bug. Table administration statements sometimes failed with "Can't lock file (errno: 155)". The fix introduces the following changes in behavior: <br />　　+ This patch changes the behavior of temporary MERGE tables. Temporary MERGE must have temporary children. The old behavior was wrong. A temporary table is not locked. Hence even non-temporary children were not locked. See Bug#19627: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/19627." target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/19627.</a> <br />　　+ You cannot change the union list of a non-temporary MERGE table when LOCK TABLES is in effect. The following does not work: CREATE TABLE m1 ... ENGINE=MRG_MYISAM ...; LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 WRITE, m1 WRITE; ALTER TABLE m1 ... UNION=(t1,t2) ...; However, you can do this with a temporary MERGE table. <br />　　+ You cannot create a MERGE table with CREATE ... SELECT, neither as a temporary MERGE table, nor as a non-temporary MERGE table. Example: CREATE TABLE m1 ... ENGINE=MRG_MYISAM ... SELECT ...; gives error message: table is not BASE TABLE.

(Bug#30904: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30904" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/30904</a>)<br /><br />- Incompatible Change: The mysql_install_db script could fail to locate some components (including resolveip) during execution if the --basedir option was specified on the command-line or within the my.cnf file. This was due to a conflict when comparing the compiled-in values and the supplied values. The --source-install command-line option to the script has been removed and replaced with the --srcdir option. mysql_install_db now locates components either using the compiled-in options, the --basedir option or --srcdir option. (Bug#30759: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/30759" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/30759</a>)<br /><br />- Incompatible Change: It was possible for option files to be read twice at program startup, if some of the standard option file locations turned out to be the same directory. Now duplicates are removed from the list of files to be read. Also, users could not override system-wide settings using ~/.my.cnf because SYSCONFDIR/my.cnf was read last. The latter file now is read earlier so that ~/.my.cnf can override system-wide settings. (Bug#20748: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/20748" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/20748</a>)<br /><br />- Partitioning: Important Note: An apostrophe or single quote character (') used in the DATA DIRECTORY, INDEX DIRECTORY, or COMMENT for a PARTITION clause caused the server to crash. When used as part of a CREATE TABLE statement, the crash was immediate. When used in an ALTER TABLE statement, the crash did not occur until trying to perform a SELECT or DML statement on the table. In either case, the server could not be completely restarted until the .FRM file corresponding to the newly created or altered table was deleted.

(Bug#22168: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/22168" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/22168</a>)<br /><br />- Selecting information from a Falcon table using a DOUBLE column with an index would produce incorrect results. (Bug#22125: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/22125" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/22125</a>)<br /><br />- The readline library has been updated to version 5.2. This addresses issues in the mysql client where history and editing within the client would fail to work as expected. (Bug#18431: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/18431" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/18431</a>)<br /><br />- mysql stripped comments from statements sent to the server. Now the --comments or --skip-comments option can be used to control whether to retain or strip comments. The default is --skip-comments. (Bug#11230: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/11230" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/11230</a>, Bug#26215: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26215" target="_blank">http://bugs.mysql.com/26215</a>)<br /><br />- Executing DISABLE KEYS and ENABLE KEYS on a non-empty table would cause the size of the index file for the table to grow considerably.
